      <h2>Talpa eCommerce</h2>
      <h3>Feature: Save Search Queries</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>For my internship at Talpa eCommerce, I was tasked with designing a feature for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vakantieveilingen.nl/">VakantieVeilingen</a> that allows users to save their search
        queries and receive alerts when new products that match their search become available. This feature is expected
        to provide users with relevant products via email alerts, while also providing insights into user demand. I
        started by studying the current user flow and conducting a brief competitive analysis to identify similar
        features on other websites, such as job boards and marketplaces. Using Miro, I created a flowchart to map out
        how the feature would work for our platform and identified the necessary design elements.</p>
      <h4>UX Flow and Design</h4>
      <p>With the UX flow mapped out, I proceeded to design the screens for the feature. I wanted to visualize how the
        toggle switch would be integrated into the search page and how the alert page would look for users. I took
        screenshots of the existing pages and imported them into Sketch, where I added the new design elements on top of
        them. I then presented the UX flow to the team, which provided me with valuable feedback on my presentation
        skills and overall design approach.</p>
      <p>I also created several icons to be used within the designs, as well as visualized how the email notifications
        associated with the feature could look. The email notifications are an integral part of the flow, so it was
        important to consider their design. I created the icons within Sketch using tools such as the line and pen
        tools. For the email design, I reviewed other email templates from the same brand that are currently live, such
        as newsletters, and incorporated the header and footer for consistency.</p>
      <p>This project was an interesting challenge as it allowed me to practice illustrating in Sketch through the
        creation of icons. The brand's iconography was not overly complex, but it was challenging enough for my level of
        expertise that I felt I had learned something from it. Email design is also not something I do every day, and
        while I do not expect my design to be implemented verbatim in the future, it serves as a solid foundation for
        further development.</p>
      <h4>Project Completion</h4>
      <p>After completing the design for all screens, I finalized the design process by incorporating feedback from
        Martina in the Sketch document and consulting with Lin to ensure that the designs align with the brand
        guidelines. Fortunately, he found the designs to be visually appealing, with only minor tweaks needed. The
        designs are now ready for handoff to the development team for implementation.</p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Working on the "Bewaar Zoekopdracht" UX flow and design was a valuable experience that allowed me to practice
        my skills in UX flow mapping, screen design, icon creation, and email design. It also provided me with an
        opportunity to present my work to the team and receive feedback on my presentation skills. Overall, I am proud
        of the final designs and confident that they will enhance the user experience on our platform by providing users
        with a convenient way to save their search queries and receive relevant product alerts.</p>
      <p>Based on these findings, I defined the following design goals for Tweaker's PC Builder:</p>
