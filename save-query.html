      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>About the project</h3>
      <p>The task for my internship at Talpa eCommerce was to design a feature for their e-commerce website,
        VakantieVeilingen. The feature would allow users to save their search queries and receive alerts when new
        products that match their search become available.</p>
      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>As a UX designer, I mapped out the UX flow, designed the screens, created icons, and email notifications
        associated with the feature.</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>The challenge was to design the feature in a way that is compact and doesn't take up a lot of important screen
        real estate while still being noticeable and easy to use. I also had to consider designing for the different
        ways users can add, edit, or delete search query alerts, including within their profile, on the search page, or
        through email notifications.</p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>Sketch designs and user flow ready for handoff to the development team for implementation.</p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>I started by studying the current user flow and conducting a competitive analysis to identify similar features
        on other websites. I created a flowchart using Miro to map out how the feature would work for our platform and
        identified the necessary design elements.</p>

      <img src="./img/save-query/3.png"
        alt="I conducted a competitive analysis to identify the different ways the feature could be implemented for our own platform.">
      <img src="./img/save-query/2.png"
        alt="I envisioned and mapped the new interaction flow, considering the various ways the user may interact with the feature.">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>With the UX flow mapped out, I designed the screens for the feature in Sketch. I also created icons and
        visualized how the email notifications associated with the feature could look. I presented my designs to the
        team and incorporated their feedback into the Sketch designs.</p>
      <img src="./img/save-query/8.png"
        alt="This earlier iteration had an exclamation mark icon to represent the alert, however this clashed with existing functionalities already using such an icon, the feedback message when enabling the alert was also abandoned as it pushed the product listings down the fold.">
      <img src="./img/save-query/5.png"
        alt="My Sketch canvas including many different variations as I explore all options and process peer feedback.">
      <img src="./img/save-query/4.png" alt="The newly designed screens incorporated into the new user flow.">
      <h2>Final Designs</h2>
      <img src="./img/save-query/6.png" alt="Toggling alerts in the search result page.">
      <img src="./img/save-query/0.png" alt="Managing alerts from the user's account.">
      <img src="./img/save-query/7.png" alt="Alert email design.">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>After completing the design for all screens, I finalized the design process by incorporating feedback from my
        internship supervisor and checking with a UX designer colleague to ensure that the designs align with the brand
        guidelines. The designs are now ready for handoff to the development team for implementation.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we didn't have the opportunity to gather user feedback or metrics on the feature during my
        internship. However one potential method I would employ now to test the viability of the feature is the painted
        door test before committing significant development
        resources to the feature.</p>
