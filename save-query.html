      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>About the Project</h3>
      <p>This project, undertaken during my internship at Talpa eCommerce, involved designing a feature for their e-commerce website, VakantieVeilingen. The objective was to enable users to save their search queries and receive alerts when new products matching their search criteria became available.</p>
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>This was a real-world project as part of my internship, and my responsibilities included mapping out the UX flow, designing screens, creating icons, and developing email notifications for the proposed feature.</p>
      <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
      <p>The main challenge was to create a compact feature that didn't dominate screen real estate while remaining noticeable and user-friendly. Additionally, I had to consider various methods users might employ to add, edit, or delete search query alerts, including within their profiles, on the search page, or through email notifications.</p>
      <h3>Role and Team</h3>
      <p>As a UX designer, I led the UX flow mapping, screen design, and the creation of associated icons and email notifications. Collaboration within the team was vital to refining the designs based on feedback.</p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>I provided Sketch designs and a user flow ready for handoff to the development team for implementation.</p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>My approach began with a thorough study of the existing user flow and a competitive analysis to identify similar features on other platforms. Using Miro, I created a flowchart to visualize the proposed feature's functionality and design elements.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>Once the UX flow was established, I used Sketch to design the feature screens, icons, and email notifications. I presented my designs to the team, incorporating their feedback into the iterative design process.</p>

      <img src="./img/save-query/7.png" alt="Alert email design.">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>Upon completing the design phase, I incorporated feedback from my internship supervisor and a UX designer colleague to ensure alignment with brand guidelines. The designs are now ready for handoff to the development team for implementation.</p>
      <p>Regrettably, due to constraints, we couldn't gather user feedback or metrics during my internship. However, I would propose utilizing the painted door test to assess the feature's viability before committing significant development resources.</p>
