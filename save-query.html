      <h2>Talpa eCommerce</h2>
      <h3>Designing a features that saves and notifies users of new search results for VakantieVeilingen, an auction
        style e-commerce website.</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>For my internship at Talpa eCommerce, I was tasked with designing a feature for their e-commerce website <a
          target="_blank" href="https://www.vakantieveilingen.nl/">VakantieVeilingen</a>, a concept that enables users
        to
        get good deals on concerts, holidays and
        miscellaneous products by bidding on them in an online auction.</p>
      <p>The proposed feature would allow users to save
        their search queries and receive alerts when new products that match their search become available. This feature
        is expected
        to provide users with relevant products via email alerts, while also providing insights into user demand.</p>
      <h4>Research</h4>
      <p>I started by studying the current user flow and conducting a brief competitive analysis to identify similar
        features on other websites, such as job boards and marketplaces. Using Miro, I created a flowchart to map out
        how the feature would work for our platform and identified the necessary design elements.</p>

        alt="I envisioned and mapped the new interaction flow, considering various user scenarios.">
      <h4>Design</h4>
      <p>With the UX flow mapped out, I proceeded to design the screens for the feature. I wanted to visualize how the
        toggle switch would be integrated into the search page and how the alert page would look for users. I took
        screenshots of the existing pages and imported them into Sketch, where I added the new design elements on top of
        them. I then presented my findings and designs to the team, which provided me with valuable feedback on my
        progress.</p>

      <p>I also created several icons to be used within the designs, as well as visualized how the email notifications
        associated with the feature could look. The email notifications are an integral part of the flow, so it was
        important to consider their design. I created the icons within Sketch using tools such as the line and pen
        tools. For the email design, I reviewed other email templates from the same brand that are currently live, such
        as newsletters, and incorporated the header and footer for consistency.</p>

      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>Designing the feature in a way that is compact and doesn't take up a lot of important screen real estate, while
        still being noticeable and easy to use, was a significant challenge. I had to consider how to balance the space
        needed for the new feature with the need to keep important, KPI-related content such as the auction listings
        visible and accessible.</p>
      <p>Another challenge was designing for the different ways users can add, edit, or delete search query alerts,
        including within their profile, on the search page, or through email notifications. To address this, I spent
        time considering the various user scenarios and made sure the feature was easily accessible from multiple
        locations.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we didn't have the opportunity to gather user feedback or metrics on the feature during my
        internship. However, if I were to test it now, one method I would consider is the painted door test. This
        involves creating a mockup or prototype and testing it with a small group of users to gather feedback on its
        usability and effectiveness. By doing so, we could test its viability before committing significant development
        resources to the feature.</p>
      <h4>Handoff</h4>
      <p>After completing the design for all screens, I finalized the design process by incorporating feedback from
        the internship supervisor into the Sketch designs and checking with a UX designer colleague to ensure that the
        designs align with the brand
        guidelines. Fortunately, he found the designs to be visually appealing, with only minor tweaks needed. The
        designs are now ready for handoff to the development team for implementation.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Working on the feature was a valuable experience that allowed me to practice
        my skills in research, interaction design, illustration and collaboration with team members. Overall, I am proud
        of the final designs and confident that they will enhance the user experience on our platform by providing users
        with a convenient way to save their search queries and receive relevant product alerts. While I do not expect my
        design to be implemented verbatim in the future, it serves as a solid foundation for
        further development.</p>
