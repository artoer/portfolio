        <p>I designed an alert feature for VakantieVeilingen that notifies users of new auctions, collaborating with users and stakeholders to map the user flow and validate the concept before handoff to development.</p>

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p class="xl">It's almost summer, and many users are ready to book their dream vacation, but there aren't any
          auctions for their destination to be found yet.</p>
        <p class="xl">What if we could notify our users as soon as they become available?</p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="section-intro">
          <h2>Exploration, inspiration, definition</h2>
          <p>I explored the current user experience, looked into different implementations of alert features, and explored how it would work on our platform and what designs I needed to deliver.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>I kicked off by investigating the current search experience, in particular when a search returns nothing of
            irrelevant listings.</p>
          <img src="./img/save-query/1.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <h3>Exploring alert functionalities</h3>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>I also looked into a variety of other implementations of the alert functionality, trying it out myself on
            several platform and taking note of the different functionalities such as alert frequency and how alerts are
            managed.</p>
          <img src="./img/save-query/3.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <h3>Mapping the flow</h3>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>Using Miro, I created a user flow to visualize the proposed feature's functionality and design elements.
            Doing this helped me inventorize the screens and interactions my designs had to account for.</p>

      <section class="process">
        <div class="section-intro">
          <h2>Design and iteration</h2>
          <p>After, I used Sketch to iteratively design the feature screens, icons, and email notifications.</p>
        </div>
        <div><img src="./img/save-query/5.png" alt=""></div>
        <div class="col-3 img-2">
          <p>I presented my designs to the team, and I received positive feedback about the incorporation of the the
            feature into the search results
            page, but they also stressed that it can't take up too much screen real estate. Understanding the potential
            harm to our conversion, I swapped the feedback message out for a different solution.</p>
          <figure><img src="./img/save-query/8.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>Before: Turning the toggle on reveals a short line of feedback below it explaining that the user
              can expect alerts in their email (We will notify you at example@domain.com).</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure> <img src="./img/save-query/iteration.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>After: Taking advantage of micro copy, I was able to convey the same message but as the label
              for the toggle (Receive email for new auctions).</figcaption>
          </figure>
      </section>
      <section class="process">
        
        <div class="section-intro">
          <h2>Handover</h2>
          <p>Returning to Miro, I integrated the finalized screens into the user flows, communicating the proposed
            feature's user experience and functionality for further implementation by sharing it in the Jira ticket,
            providing the development team with guidance for the next phase of implementation.</p>

        <div><img src="./img/save-query/4.png" alt=""></div>

      <section class="process">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>This was a smaller task during my internship that taught me a lot about the importance of user flows, in
            this case the user could interact with the feature in many different ways, resulting in many states that had
            to be accounted for. Mapping these interaction flows gave me a clear idea of what screens needed to be
            crafted before even opening Sketch. I also found the completed user flow, supplemented by my designs,
            especially useful for the collection of feedback and handover.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, there was no opportunity during my internship to test or gather user feedback on the
            feature. However, if I had the chance now, I would probably start, at the very least, with a painted door
            test to gauge user interest in the feature and viability before committing resources on development.</p>
