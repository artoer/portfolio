          <p class="challenge">How might we enable users to save search terms and receive notifications about new,
            relevant products?</p>
          <p>During my 5-month internship at Talpa eCommerce I was approached by the product owner to explore the idea
            of a feature that would allow users to set an alert for searches they're interested in.</p>

          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <h2>Hitting a dead end</h2>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vakantieveilingen.nl/">VakantieVeilingen</a> is a platform owned by
            Talpa eCommerce that specializes in selling a variety of products by auctioning them among users.</p>
          <p>Sometimes popular destinations or products aren't available, leaving the user with empty search results and
            no follow-up. To
            solve this, one product owner came up with the idea to create an alert functionality inspired by job
            boards and online market places.

          </p>

              sporadically, the user is out of luck this time and has hit a dead end.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>As the CRO/UX Design intern at Talpa eCommerce, I was tasked with ideating on this idea and provide an
            answer to the design challenge:
            <strong>How might we enable users to save search terms and receive notifications about new,
              relevant products?</strong></p>

          <h4>The process</h4>
          <h2>Flows and inspiration</h2>
          <p>My approach began with a thorough study of the existing user flow and a competitive analysis to identify
            similar features on other platforms.</p>

              additional functionalities such as notification frequency.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Using Miro, I created a user flow to visualize the proposed feature's
            functionality and design elements. Doing this helped me inventorize the screens and iteractions my designs
            had
            to account for.</p>

          <h2>Iterating and gathering feedback</h2>
          <p>After, I used Sketch to iteratively design the feature screens, icons, and email notifications.

              <img src="./img/save-query/5.png"

              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I presented my designs to the team, and they liked how I incorporated the feature into the search results
              page, but they also stressed that it can't take up too much screen real estate. Understanding the
              potential harm to our conversion, I swapped the feedback message out for a different solution.</p>

              <figcaption>After: Taking advantage of micro copy, I was able to convey the same message but as the label

          <h2>Handover</h2>
          <p>Returning to Miro, I integrated the finalized screens into the user flows, communicating the
            proposed feature's user experience and functionality for further implementation by sharing it in the Jira
            ticket, providing the development team with guidance for the next phase of implementation.</p>

          <h4>The solution</h4>
          <h2>Final designs</h2>
          <p>My solution enables users to set alerts for new search results directly from the search page or their
            account.
            Users can easily manage these alerts, including editing and deleting them, and view matching results.
            Additionally, I propose an email notification design with the option to disable alerts directly from the
            inbox.

            <figcaption>Alert email design proposal.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
          <p>The new search alert functionality enhances user engagement by helping them discover specific auctions,
            even
            when unavailable, ultimately providing a follow-up step for potential conversions.</p>

          <h4>Closing</h4>
          <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
          <p>This was a smaller task during my internship that taught me a lot about the importance of user flows, in
            this
            case the user could interact with the feature in many different ways, resulting in many states that had to
            be
            accounted for. Mapping these interaction flows gave me a clear idea of what screens needed to be crafted
            before
            even opening Sketch. I also found the completed user flow, supplemented by my
            designs, especially
            useful for the collection of feedback and the final handover.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, there was no opportunity during my internship to test or gather user feedback on the
            feature.
            However, if I had the chance now, I would probably start, at the very least, with a painted door test to
            gauge
            user interest in the
            feature and viability before committing resources on development.</p>
