      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>About the Project</h3>
      <p>This project, undertaken during my internship at Talpa eCommerce, involved designing a feature for their
        e-commerce website, VakantieVeilingen. The objective was to enable users to save their search queries and
        receive alerts when new products matching their search criteria became available.</p>
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>This was a real-world project as part of my internship, and my responsibilities included mapping out the UX
        flow, designing screens, creating icons, and developing email notifications for the proposed feature.</p>
      <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
      <p>The main challenge was to create a compact feature that didn't dominate screen real estate while remaining
        noticeable and user-friendly. Additionally, I had to consider various methods users might employ to add, edit,
        or delete search query alerts, including within their profiles, on the search page, or through email
        notifications.</p>
      <h3>Role and Team</h3>
      <p>As a UX designer, I led the UX flow mapping, screen design, and the creation of associated icons and email
        notifications. Collaboration within the team was vital to refining the designs based on feedback.</p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>I provided Sketch designs and a user flow ready for handoff to the development team for implementation.</p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>My approach began with a thorough study of the existing user flow and a competitive analysis to identify
        similar features on other platforms. Using Miro, I created a flowchart to visualize the proposed feature's
        functionality and design elements.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>Once the UX flow was established, I used Sketch to design the feature screens, icons, and email notifications.
        I presented my designs to the team, incorporating their feedback into the iterative design process.</p>

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>Upon completing the design phase, I incorporated feedback from my internship supervisor and a UX designer
        colleague to ensure alignment with brand guidelines. The designs ready for handoff to the development
        team for implementation.</p>

      <h2>Validation</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, there was no opportunity during my internship to test or gather user feedback on the feature.
        However, if I had the chance now, I would probably start, at the very least, with a painted door test to gauge user interest in the
        feature and viability before committing resources on development.</p>
