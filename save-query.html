      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vakantieveilingen.nl/">VakantieVeilingen</a> is a platform owned by
          Talpa
          eCommerce that specializes in
          selling a variety of products by auctioning them among users.</p>
        <p>During my internship I was tasked to conceptualize a feature that would enable users to save, and be
          notified of, auctions that match their interests by allowing users to save their search keywords.</p>
        <figure class="insert">
          <blockquote>
            <p>How may we design a functionality that empowers users to save personalized search
              terms, receive notifications for matching auctions, and thereby enhance their platform engagement?</p>
          </blockquote>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Competitive Analysis and User Flows</h3>
      <p>My approach began with a thorough study of the existing user flow and a competitive analysis to identify
        similar features on other platforms.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/save-query/1.png" alt="Image showcasing a simple flow map, highlighting painpoints">
        <figcaption>Simplified mapping of the existing flow, highlighting the lack of a "follow-up" after a search
          yields no results.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/save-query/3.png"
          alt="Screenshot of Miro showcasing a collection of alerts employed by other products">
        <figcaption>Competitive analysis, exploring the different ways other platforms employ saved alerts and
          additional functionalities such as notification frequency.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Using Miro, I created a user flow to visualize the proposed feature's
        functionality and design elements. Doing this helped me inventorize the screens and iteractions my designs had
        to account for.</p>

          alt="Image showing the flow of how users can add, remove and modify their alerts">

      </figure>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Iterative Design</h3>
      <p>After, I used Sketch to iteratively design the feature screens, icons, and email notifications.
        I presented my designs to the team, incorporating their feedback into the iterative design process.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/save-query/8.png" alt="Screenshot of Sketch showing an early iteration">
        <figcaption>Early iteration, where enabling the toggle displays a message with feedback, this was removed in
          later iterations as it was too costly in terms of screen real estate.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>

          alt="Screenshot; zoomed out view of Sketch showing all considered options and iterations">
        <figcaption>Sketch canvas with various iterative design explorations and the results of feedback.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Handover</h3>
      <p>Returning to Miro, I integrated the finalized screens into the user flows, communicating the
        proposed feature's user experience and functionality for further implementation by sharing it in the Jira
        ticket, providing the development team with guidance for the next phase of implementation.</p>

          alt="Screenshot; user flow accompanied with designed screens displaying how users interact with the feature">

      </figure>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>My solution enables users to set alerts for new search results directly from the search page or their account.
        Users can easily manage these alerts, including editing and deleting them, and view matching results.
        Additionally, I propose an email notification design with the option to disable alerts directly from the inbox.
      </p>

          alt="Screenshot of the search results page, with integration of the new feature">

          alt="Screenshot of how the alert email may look, a product that matches the set alert prominently displayed">
        <figcaption>Alert email design proposal.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
      <p>The new search alert functionality enhances user engagement by helping them discover specific auctions, even
        when unavailable, ultimately providing a follow-up step for potential conversions.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>This was a smaller task during my internship that taught me a lot about the importance of user flows, in this
        case the user could interact with the feature in many different ways, resulting in many states that had to be
        accounted for. Mapping these interaction flows gave me a clear idea of what screens needed to be crafted before
        even opening Sketch. I also found the completed user flow, supplemented by my
        designs, especially
        useful for the collection of feedback and the final handover.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there was no opportunity during my internship to test or gather user feedback on the feature.
        However, if I had the chance now, I would probably start, at the very least, with a painted door test to gauge
        user interest in the
        feature and viability before committing resources on development.</p>
