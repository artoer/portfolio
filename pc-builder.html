        <h1>Streamlining PC&nbsp;Building</h1>
        <div>
          <p class="challenge">How might we create a tool that assists Tweakers users, known for their expertise in building PCs, in a way
            that they find valuable?</p>
          <p>During my 5-month internship at Tweakers running from November 2022 to April 2023, I led a graduation
            project to create a user-friendly PC
            component selection tool. Guided by Bo, the senior UX designer, I engaged with users, stakeholders and my
            designer colleagues to ensure
            relevance and value for Tweakers' expert PC-building community.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <div id="content">

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>The problem</h2>
          <p>Tweakers.net is a Dutch consumer electronics and technology-focused website well known for its community,
            editorial content, and comprehensive price comparison tool.</p>
          <p>In November 2022, I returned to Tweakers for an internship and my bachelor's graduation project. With Bo's
            support, I proposed a PC builder project to leverage Tweakers' tech focus and vast component database.</p>
          <figure><img src="./img/pc-builder/pricewatch.png" alt="The Tweakers Pricewatch page">
            <figcaption>Tweakers is already popular among PC builders for its focus on tech and powerful price
              comparison tool — The Pricewatch</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Tweakers users already having a high affinity with tech and PCs, the challenge central to this project was:
            How
            may we create a tool that assists Tweakers users, known for their expertise in building PCs, in a way that
            they find valuable?</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h4>How experienced users build</h4>
          <h2>Mistakes despite experience</h2>
          <p>Eager to know more about how Tweakers users build PCs, I reached out and interviewed five users. Four out
            of five users were all indeed very experienced, having built three, four or even more PCs in
            their lives.</p>
          <aside>
            <p>...I once ended up with a power supply that wouldn't fit, completely overlooking that it was meant for
              small form factor PCs</p>
          </aside>
          <p> But what surprised me the most is that despite their experience, they all had an anecdote to
            share about something they overlooked when they built their PC and the frustrating consequences thereof,
            such as the lengthy return processes and being unable to use the PC until they have the right part.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h4>What users care about</h4>
          <h2>Bang for your buck</h2>
          <p>Questioning how Tweakers users built their PCs, two words especially stood out to me as a trend:
            price and performance. It became clear why when I asked what they used their PCs for; gaming and the
            occassional 3D modeling, both very power-hungry use cases.</p>
          <aside>
            <p>64.7% of Tweakers users prioritize price-performance over all else</p>
          </aside>
          <p>Launching a survey to triangulate my interview findings, I received 425 responses that confirmed that
            Tweakers users have plentiful experience building PCs, and that they indeed prioritize price and performance
            most
            of all.</p>

          <h4>Analysing the competiton</h4>
          <h2>Disjointed user flow</h2>
          <p>Comparing and analysing other tools, I saw a great amount of inspiration, but also things that could be
            better. What especially irked me about a tool like PCPartPicker is that you had to constantly jump from page
            to page as
            you built your pc.</p>
          <figure>

          <p>On one hand dedicating an entire page for processors allows for in depth browsing, but I felt like there
            had to be a way to retain the overview.</p>

            <figcaption>Newegg.com - with their PC builder tool on the right</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>I saw a potential solution on Newegg, where the tool took the form
            of a drawer on the side for the PC build as the user browsed components. Noting the similarities between
            Newegg's store page and Tweaker's Pricewatch, this design direction was very influential to me.</p>
          <aside>
            <p>Competing tools using separate pages create a fragmented experience
              with a higher cognitive load</p>

          <h4>Deciding on the design</h4>
          <h2>Sketching and gathering input</h2>
          <p>Wireframing early concept directions in FigJam provided a starting point and a great
            discussion piece
            when engaging with users and stakeholders.</p>

          </figure>
          </figure>
          <p>Doing my rounds with stakeholders, I gathered several valuable insights as I converged towards a solution.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The editorial writers specialized in PCs provided valuable insights and feedback that helped guide the
              information architecture of the tool, and expressed their preference for Pricewatch integration as PC
              builders.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside>
            <p>We, and many other people usually start with the CPU — in fact, shops [like Newegg] will even sell
              processors at a loss to hook people in to buy the rest</p>
          </aside>
          <ul>
            <li>Back-end development enlightened me about the feasability of a compatibility check using the existing
              Pricewatch data — and while feasible — I unfortunately learned it wouldn't be easy.</li>
            <li>The head of the component testing lab made several valuable suggestions on how to display a
              price-performance ratio, and confirmed the existence of standardized performance scores.</li>
            <li>The product team exchanged valuable feedback and suggestions to enhance the project, for example
              encouraging me to focus on the core components to simplify the experience.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An additional user survey, yielding 445 responses, helped me hone in on the design direction, and supported
            what the PC experts in
            the editorial team told me.</p>

          <h4>Iteration</h4>
          <h2>From sketch to prototype</h2>
          <p>Utilizing the existing design system, I worked towards a higher fidelity design in Figma, balancing
            requirements and
            information density and incorporating stakeholder feedback with each iteration.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Once finished, I made the prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript, allowing me create a non-linear testing
            environment with complex logic, which suits the nature of the tool well.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>The first round of usability testing was mixed, overall the tool performed okay, but there were still a few
            critical points of improvement for the tool, thankfully these were all fairly remediable.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The tool was <strong>collapsed by default, significantly hurting its discoverability</strong>;
              participants
              would not even
              open the tool unprompted</li>
            <li>The tool <strong>didn't prevent user error</strong>, but would only correct the users afterwards</li>
            <li>The tool also <strong>didn't provide the participants with a next step after an error was made</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h4>Iterate, try again</h4>
          <h2>Addressing the findings</h2>
          <p>Back to the drawing board, I sketched several ways to improve feed forward and feedback in the tool, as
            well as provide users a clear way to remedy potential errors.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./img/pc-builder/omit.png" alt="Showcasing the solution where incompatible components are disabled user interaction.">
              <figcaption>I experimented with both disabling (shown here) and entirely hiding incompatible components at first.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>But our expert users insisted on being able to see and pick <em>all parts</em>. Given that most incompatibilities can be resolved in more than one way (either swap part A <em>or</em> part
              B), it was logical keep all options open, as long as I made sure users are well aware of potential configuration issues.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/pc-builder/fix.png" alt="Showcasing attempts to provide feed forward and feedback on component choice.">
            <figcaption>The error now includes a follow-up action towards a solution (left) and I now warn users before
              picking components to prevent this in the first place (right)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>In the follow-up tests the tool performed noticeably better, the second round of participants smoothly
            moving through
            the scenarios I prepared for them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>With the tool expanded by default, <strong>participants immediately discovered the tool</strong> and
              started using it</li>
            <li>Partipants approached their scenario of building a PC much more smoothly thanks to the <strong>feed
                forward
                highlighting the correct choices.</strong></li>
            <li>Participants were much more positive about the tool in general, <strong>they found the user experience
                smooth and easy to use</strong></li>
            <li>The particpants left me with a few more recommendations to consider, such as <strong>being able to share
                the list
                with family or friends.</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <aside>
            <p>The tool provides clear information, is easy to use, matches Tweakers' style, and worked smoothly without
              any clutter or distractions</p>
          </aside>
          <h3>Test scoring</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>3.9 out of 5</strong> — For the tool's prevention and resolution of component incompatibilities
            </li>
            <li><strong>4.1 out of 5</strong> — For the tool's display of key component information</li>

          <h4>Outcome</h4>
          <h2>Potential impact and future</h2>
          <p>At the time of writing the tool has not yet been implemented, and I am no longer employed or interning at
            Tweakers. However I have several (optimistic)
            expectations on how it would impact the business.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Increased website traffic by offering a localized experience tailored for Dutch PC builders</li>
            <li>Increased usage of referral links as users finalize their PC build with partnered web shops</li>
            <li>Higher engagement with ad-sponsored content such a PC component reviews and guides</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On the other hand, I believe the tool would require a lot of maintenance, making and keeping the
            component data usable for the tool would be especially labor intensive, as well the occassional edge case or
            bug.</p>
          <h3>A word from my mentor and supervisor</h3>

            <blockquote>
              <p>...Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
                steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
                the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
                that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
                product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>This was an invaluable experience as a real-world, end-to-end design project and I'm thankful to Tweakers
            for the opportunity. Hopefully the tool will indeed be implemented one day but I have to admit that it would
            require a lot of buy-in and effort to overcome technical contraints.
            <p>
              If time had permitted it I would've liked to dive deeper into and learn more about justifying the
              viability
              of
              the concept to stakeholders, especially from a business standpoint.</p>
            <p>
              I also would've liked to expand the scope of the tool and explore more user journeys, for example
              envisioning
              of what comes after a user saves their component list, as that has unfortunately been left open ended.</p>
