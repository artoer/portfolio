      <p>I led the end-to-end design of a PC building tool for Tweakers, the Netherlands' largest tech community, for my capstone project, collaborating with users and stakeholders to create Figma wireframes and validate with a hand-coded prototype.</p>

        <h2>Helping tech savvy users build computers</h2>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>I designed a tool that helps Tweakers users build PCs by providing them an intuitive way to browse and make
            fool-proof, informed choices for their computer components.</p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <h2>Getting to know the user</h2>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>To understand how Tweakers users build PCs, I reached out and interviewed five users while also inviting
            thousands of Tweakers visitors to complete a survey.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p><strong>Even experienced PC builders make mistakes.</strong> Each user had made a mistake at some point building their PC,
            and
            the frustrating consequences thereof, such as lengthy return processes.</p>
          <figure>
            <blockquote>‚Äú...it turned out the component was too small ‚Äî it was meant for a small form factor PC.‚Äù

            <figcaption>‚Äî Tweakers user on common PC build mishaps</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <h3>Surveys</h3>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>I also learned a lot about what users think about when choosing components,
            <strong>price and performance were two key words came up a lot in the interviews</strong>, and the survey confirmed that <strong>
              a
              staggering 64.7% of Tweakers users prioritize price-performance over all else.

        <h2>Analyzing the competition</h2>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>In addition to user research, I analyzed other tools, I saw a great amount of inspiration, but also areas
            where our tool could offer a better user experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>PCPartPicker does a great job <strong>giving feedback on user error</strong>. But <strong>
              the user experience was disjointed and
              lacked oversight</strong>, with the overview and different components <strong>spread out over multiple pages.</strong></p>

        <div class="col-3">
          <p>On Newegg, the tool took the form of a drawer on the side, <strong>
            allowing the user to browse components while
              keeping track of their build‚Äîall in one screen.

              <span class="label">Poor discoverability</span>
              <p>The tool was collapsed by default, significantly hurting its discoverability; participants would not
                even open the tool unprompted.</p>
            </div>

              <span class="label">No prevention</span>
              <p>The tool didn't prevent user error, but would only warn the user <strong>after</strong> making an
                incompatible choice.</p>

        <h3>Iteration</h3>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>Back to the drawing board, I sketched several ways to improve feed forward and feedback in the tool, as
            well as provide users a clear way to remedy potential errors. For the discoverability, I changed the tool to
            be expanded on default, instead of collapsed.</p>

        <div class="col-3 img-2">
          <p>Checking in with stakeholders, they stressed that they always want to be able to see and pick all parts‚Äîso
            instead of hiding
            or disabling incompatible components, the users will keep full control, and they'll instead be warned in
            advance.</p>

        <h3>User satisfaction</h3>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>The tool performed noticeable better in the follow-up test. The tool was easily discovered and users were
            quick to use it to assemble the PCs for their scenarios without error.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>This was an invaluable experience as a real-world, end-to-end design project and I'm thankful to Tweakers
            for the opportunity. Hopefully the tool will indeed be implemented one day but I have to admit that it would
            require a lot of buy-in and effort to overcome technical contraints. </p>
          <p>If time had permitted it I would've liked to dive deeper into and learn more about justifying the
            viability of the concept to stakeholders, especially from a business standpoint.</p>
          <p> I also would've liked to expand the scope of the tool and explore more user journeys, for example
            envisioning of what comes after a user saves their component list, as that has unfortunately been left open
            ended.</p>
