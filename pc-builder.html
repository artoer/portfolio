      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>About the Client</h3>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a consumer electronics and
        technology-focused website, specializing in computers. Its revenue model relies on advertising and affiliate
        programs, including the Pricewatch, a prominent price comparison tool for electronics.</p>
      <h3>About the Product</h3>
      <p>I developed a tool for Tweakers designed to assist experienced users in building custom PCs. Integrated into
        the existing Pricewatch functionality, the tool provides insights into price-performance ratios, component
        information, ensures compatibility, and offers recommendations from the Tweakers editorial team.</p>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>As part of my graduation project, I independently managed the end-to-end design process for the PC Builder
        tool. My responsibilities included user research, stakeholder management, requirement definition, brainstorming,
        wireframing, creating a clickable prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and validating the design with
        users.</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Designing a digital tool to assist experienced computer builders involved addressing compatibility issues, user
        preferences, and budget constraints. Identifying user needs and creating a tool that guides them in selecting
        the right components for custom PC builds posed a significant challenge.</p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>A successfully tested clickable prototype of the PC Builder tool, along with conclusive recommendations for
        future implementations.</p>
      <p>View the prototype <a target="_blank" href=".\assets\pc-builder-prototype\index.html">here</a>.</p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>My strategy included a competitive analysis, user interviews, and surveys to gather insights on existing
        solutions and understand user needs.</p>
      <p>I learned who the users of Tweakers are, how they approached
        building or tinkering on their pc's, and how they all cared especially much about getting the most performance
        for their money.

        alt='User poll: "What information do you find most important when choosing a PC component?" (N=425, 64.7% prioritize "price-performance ratio").'>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>Using brainstorming techniques and user research, I generated concepts, selected a direction, and further
        wireframed the chosen concept, utilizing feedback from peers and stakeholders with each iteration. The wireframes evolved into a responsive prototype, allowing comprehensive
        testing of various scenarios with users.</p>

        alt="Final version of the prototype, addressing identified issues and incorporating feedback during testing.">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>The PC Builder tool received positive feedback during usability testing and from the Tweakers community,
        particularly praising its insight into the price-performance ratio. Future opportunities include A/B tests and
        features like sharing PC builds. Feedback from Bozhan, Tweakers' Senior UX designer, confirms the tool's success
        and readiness for implementation.</p>
      <blockquote cite="Bozhan, Senior UX designer at Tweakers">
        <p>As a UX designer at Tweakers and the supervisor of the internship programme at
          the company, I would say that the PC Builder feature that Arthur designed and
          prototyped is complete and fulfils all requirements we set at the beginning of the
          project. The user journey is clear, there are helpful error messages and warnings
          along the way, components have clearly indicated empty and filled states, and the
          entire interaction has a clear end goal.</p>
        <p>The success of the prototype I find is largely due to the rigorous research and testing
          process that Arthur applied to his project. The fact he designed and developed the
          tool iteratively, testing at each stage, meant that the decisions he took at each turn
          were validated and supported by solid qualitative and quantitative insights. The final
          evaluation of the prototype by the Tweakers community is a testament to this.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
          steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
          the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
          that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
          product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>
