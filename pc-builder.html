      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>About Tweakers</h3>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a consumer electronics and
        technology-focused website, specializing in computers. Its revenue model relies on advertising and affiliate
        programs, including the Pricewatch, a prominent price comparison tool for electronics.</p>
      <h3>About the Product</h3>
      <p>I developed a tool for Tweakers designed to assist experienced users in building custom PCs. Integrated into
        the existing Pricewatch functionality, the tool provides insights into price-performance ratios, component
        information, ensures compatibility, and offers recommendations from the Tweakers editorial team.</p>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>As part of my graduation project, I independently managed the end-to-end design process for the PC Builder
        tool. My responsibilities included user research, stakeholder management, requirement definition, brainstorming,
        wireframing, creating a clickable prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and validating the design with
        users.</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Designing a digital tool to assist experienced computer builders involved addressing compatibility issues, user
        preferences, and budget constraints. Identifying user needs and creating a tool that guides them in selecting
        the right components for custom PC builds posed a significant challenge.</p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>A successfully tested clickable prototype of the PC Builder tool, along with conclusive recommendations for
        future implementations.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My strategy included a competitive analysis, user interviews, and surveys to gather insights on existing
        solutions and understand user needs.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/0.png"
        alt="Competitive analysis and inspiration from different approaches, such as LogicalIncrements.">
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/1.png"
        alt='User poll: "What information do you find most important when choosing a PC component?" (N=425, 64.7% prioritize "price-performance ratio").'>
      <p>The insights gathered from a combination of user interviews and surveys shaped the following
        must-have requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compatibility Check —</strong> The tool addresses the common issue of users, even experienced ones,
          overlooking
          incompatibilities during PC builds, potentially resulting in wasted time and money.</li>
        <li><strong>Component Information —</strong> Users prioritize key information such as performance,
          price-performance ratio, user reviews, and specifications when selecting components.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations —</strong> Acknowledging the reliance of users on recommendations, the tool offers
          valuable suggestions during the component selection process.</li>
        <li><strong>Usability —</strong> The tool maintains clarity and user-friendliness, ensuring that users can
          easily
          navigate and access essential information throughout the process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>During the ideation phase, I employed sketching and brainstorming techniques like Crazy Eight, for example to
        find effective ways to communicate the price-to-performance ratio to users. This led me to explore various
        solutions, eventually combining them into conceptual ideas to address the project requirements and to find the
        layout, form and positioning that works for Tweakers.

        alt="Initial idea as a result of a Crazy Eight brainstorming session: The tool as an expandable and collapsible overlay on the Pricewatch page.">
      <p>Continuously engaging with users and stakeholders at Tweakers validated previous design choices and revealed
        new insights that shaped the overall tool and its flow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Journey —</strong> Users and the Tweakers editorial team demonstrated a strong preference for
          starting the component
          selection with the processor, motherboard, and graphics card, respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Positioning —</strong> Stakeholders also expressed a preference for hosting the tool on the
          Pricewatch page, emphasizing its
          integration with component browsing and pricing</li>
      </ul>

        alt="User preference survey result: 83.1% prefer a tool integrated into the Pricewatch.">
      <h2>Iteration</h2>
      <p>Having identified the concept that best aligned with user and stakeholder needs, I advanced to the next phase
        by translating my ideas into concrete designs. Taking my sketches to Figma, I initiated the wireframing process
        to visualize the initial structure of the PC Builder tool.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/21.jpg"
        alt="Initial wireframe sketch showcasing the tool's interface, used to pitch to stakeholders.">
      <p>While sketching and wireframing I learned a lot about the challenges and constraints of the taken direction,
        such as the limited amount of space. Iterations focused on striking the right balance of the size of the
        elements and clarity, exploring ways to compactly yet effectively convey important component information. I also
        ensured that the design as a whole felt at home for Tweakers.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/14.jpg"
        alt="The tool's interface several iterations in, incorporating insights from the sketching process and stakeholder feedback.">
      <p>When the design was ready and all possible interactions were accounted for, I transitioned to turning these
        into a
        prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Leveraging my technical skills to make a prototype that can handle
        various user scenarios during usability testing, making it feel like a real version of the tool.</p>
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/18.png"
        alt="Final version of the clickable prototype, addressing identified issues and incorporating feedback during usability testing.">
      <ul>
        <li>Provides valuable insights into what users care most about when choosing components: performance and value
          metrics, key specifications and power consumption</li>
        <li>Safeguards users from potential mistakes by providing both feed forward and feedback during component
          choice, and guides user in resolving these issues or conflicts</li>
        <li>Integration with Tweakers' Pricewatch, leveraging its extensive filters and offering the cheapest available
          price alongside the tool</li>
        <li>Fill the tool with editorial recommendations at the click of a button, offering a good starting point for
          users or options to consider</li>
        <li>User-friendly and described as clear and easy to use during usability testing</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Validation</h2>
      <p>After finalizing the design and prototype, I conducted comprehensive testing to refine the tool.
        Initial
        feedback from participants revealed areas for enhancement, such as providing feed forward for error prevention,
        as well as some low-hanging fruit regarding usability and discoverability.</p>
      <q>The first iteration did a good job of giving the user feedback on their component choices; however, users truly missed feedforward as well—showing what components would be incompatible even before being
        picked.</q>
      <p>
        Once these issues were addressed the tool was received well in the tests that followed and by the community, who
        at this stage had
        been given access to the prototype to gauge sentiment and gather feedback.</p> <img
        src="./img/pc-builder/19.png"
        alt="Overall impression of the Tweakers community regarding the PC Builder tool (higher is better).">
      <p>Future recommendations
        include A/B testing for clearer interactions, enhancing the visibility of recommendations, enabling list
        sharing,
        and displaying performance metrics in the Pricewatch list. These refinements aim to further elevate the tool's
        functionality and user engagement.</p>
      <blockquote cite="Bozhan, Senior UX designer at Tweakers">
        <p>As a UX designer at Tweakers and the supervisor of the internship programme at
          the company, I would say that the PC Builder feature that Arthur designed and
          prototyped is complete and fulfils all requirements we set at the beginning of the
          project. The user journey is clear, there are helpful error messages and warnings
          along the way, components have clearly indicated empty and filled states, and the
          entire interaction has a clear end goal.</p>
        <p>The success of the prototype I find is largely due to the rigorous research and testing
          process that Arthur applied to his project. The fact he designed and developed the
          tool iteratively, testing at each stage, meant that the decisions he took at each turn
          were validated and supported by solid qualitative and quantitative insights. The final
          evaluation of the prototype by the Tweakers community is a testament to this.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
          steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
          the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
          that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
          product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>
