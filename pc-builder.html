      <h2>Tweakers</h2>
      <h1>Designing a PC builder, a much-requested feature for the tech-focused Tweakers.net community.</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a popular Dutch consumer electronics
        and technology website, with a strong focus on computers. As a frequent visitor to the website, I noticed a lack
        of tools to help users easily assemble a computer. Currently, users have to research and ensure compatibility of
        each component themselves.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with Tweakers, I took it upon myself to explore and design a tool that would help the users of
        Tweakers pick the right parts when building their PCs for my graduation project. In this case study, I will
        outline my process and conclusions in developing a concept, validating it, and providing recommendations for
        future implementation.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/2.png" alt="The front page of Tweakers, featuring articles on tech-related news.">
      <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
      <p>Many computer components have varying compatibility requirements and specifications, making it challenging for
        users to select the right components to build their computer. Additionally, users must consider their own needs
        when it comes to
        criteria performance and budget.</p>
      <p><strong>How can we create a digital interactive tool that assists Tweakers users, particularly experienced
        computer
        builders, in selecting the right components for their build?</strong></p>
      <h4>Research</h4>
      <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
      <p>I kicked off my research by conducting an exploratory competitive analysis to investigate how different
        competitors assist users in building a computer, to explore how they approach the problem and to gain insights
        on the strengths and weaknesses of
        their approaches.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/0.png"
        alt="Aside from the obvious competitors, I also liked to look at websites that took a different approach such as LogicalIncrements. A website that offers recommendations based on a budget rather than a tool. The website had some interesting ways to display information I took note of.">
      <h5>Interview</h5>
      <p>To better understand the target audience and the customer journey when building a computer, I conducted five
        semi-structured interviews. I discovered that the price-to-performance ratio was the most important factor in
        choosing a component. Gaming was the most common use case. Users relied heavily on recommendations, such as
        guides, reviews, and YouTube videos, for individual components and complete builds. The competing PCPartPicker
        tool was less frequently used due to a lack of Dutch webshop integration. Users mainly kept track of their
        builds using Wordpad lists, shopping carts, or separate browser tabs for each component.</p>
      <p>Through the interviews it became clear that even experienced users - who had built multiple PCs -
        were prone to making mistakes, highlighting the importance of a compatibility check no matter the level of expertise.</p>
      <blockquote cite="An interviewee">
        <p>...For example, I bought a small-form factor power supply on accident, and it
          turned out the cables were too short to use in my mid-size case.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h5>Survey</h5>
      <p>I also conducted a survey to obtain new insights and validate my earlier research. I shared the survey on the
        Tweakers website's Pricewatch pages for PC components, where my target audience was most accessible. With 425
        respondents, the majority of computer builders were experienced or highly experienced, with over 68.2% having
        built a computer more than four times. The survey validated that the target audience values the
        price-to-performance ratio most of all.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/1.png"
        alt='Poll: "What information do you find most important when choosing a PC component? The vast majority (64.7%) chose "price-to-performance ratio" (N=425).'>
      <h4>Concept Requirements</h4>
      <ul>
        <p>Based on the biggest takeaways of my research I set the following requirements for the PC builder:</p>
        <li>
          <strong>The tool checks product compatibility</strong>
          <p>Despite the audience's extensive experience in assembling computers, they may overlook incompatibilities,
            which can ultimately cost them time and money.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The tool provides insight into the most important information about components</strong>
          <p>According to the audience, the most important information about components is performance and
            price-performance ratio, performance, price, user reviews, and specifications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The tool offers recommendations to the user</strong>
          <p>When assembling computers, the audience often relies on recommendations from others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The tool is clear and easy to navigate</strong>
          <p>The user can easily maintain an overview, and the most important information is visible to the audience.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Brainstorming & Ideation</h4>
      <p>During the ideation phase, I first analyzed the competition to identify best, good, and bad practices. One of
        the best practices that inspired me was Newegg's tool, which was integrated into the product catalog, creating a
        seamless user experience. I also found that tools that efficiently utilized screen space and provided important
        information were good practices, while tools with long and cluttered component lists and inadequate information
        were bad practices.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/7.png"
        alt="During my analysis of good and bad practices, I was greatly inspired by the tool on Newegg, which featured the tool as a sort of overlay on top of a catalogue of products much like Tweakers' Pricewatch.">
      <p>With the set requirements in mind, I brainstormed potential solutions using the "how may we"
        technique, followed by the Crazy Eight method to generate out-of-the-box ideas. I combined the ideas from both
        sessions to create potential concept directions for my project.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/8.png"
        alt='"How may we provide insight into the compatibility between components?" Answered by using the Crazy Eight method. While valueable, in hindsight I should have done this with pen and paper.'>
      <p>I came up with three concept directions. The three concepts I explored included a solution which integrates the
        tool on the
        right-hand side of the existing Pricewatch product list view. A solution where the feature exists on its own
        dedicated page, and lastly a user-friendly visual display on a seperate page to support building a
        computer.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/9.jpg" alt='Concept 3, the "dashboard" solution. As mocked up in the FigJam file.'>
      <p>To help decide on the direction, I reached out to two tech journalists who write for Tweakers and
        conducted a new survey. During the expert interview, the journalists appreciated the feedback that the tool
        provided and preferred a hybrid form between the first and second design direction. They also expressed no
        interest in visual support, so they didn't like the third design direction.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/6.png"
        alt="To help decide on the right concept, I polled the target audience, who seemed to heavily prefer a solution integrated into the Pricewatch. Out of 445 responses, 83.1% of users say that they would rather see a tool that helps them build a PC on the Pricewatch rather than a seperate page in their account of profile.">
      <p>Based on the survey results, 83.1%
        of users preferred the tool to be integrated within the Pricewatch environment rather than hidden within their
        user profile.</p>
      <p>With both the expert interview and survey results in mind, I decided to move forward with the
        first design direction. The expert interview and survey helped me better understand my target audience's
        preferences and thought process when building a computer, which guided my decision for the design direction and
        ensured that the final product aligned with their needs and wants.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/10.jpg"
        alt='The chosen direction, Concept 1, where the tool is integrated into the Pricewatch page. Shown here is the first iteration mocked up in the FigJam file, the design would later be taken to Figma.'>
      <h4>Design Refinement</h4>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/11.jpg"
        alt='This is the first iteration of the design in Figma. Note the width, which makes the tool feel cramped. I addressed this issue in later iterations.'>
      <p>During the design process, I made several iterations to the tool to improve its functionality and aesthetics.
        In the first iteration, I addressed the issue of a cramped tool by increasing its width to align with the
        Tweakers design system. In later iterations, I added "recommendation" buttons, fine-tuned feedback messages, and
        warnings under components to provide a clear understanding of any issues. I also experimented with visually
        appealing designs for displaying the price-performance ratio, including icons and tables, but ultimately decided
        on a minimalist approach to avoid clutter.</p>
      <h4>Concept Overview</h4>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/14.jpg"
        alt='The final iteration in the Figma file showcases the various states and features. The prototype and subsequent iterations would build upon this design.'>
      <ul>
        <h5>Key Features</h5>
        <li>Integration into the Tweakers Pricewatch page, leveraging existing features such as detailed
          filters, reducing development time, and enhancing discoverability.</li>
        <li>Uninterrupted navigation between product categories as the user browses and selects their components</li>
        <li>The ability to view the performance and price-to-performance ratio of core components</li>
        <li>The ability to view the power provision and consumption of the build</li>
        <li>Import recommendations from Tweakers' Best Buy Guides</li>
        <li>Collapsible when not in use, while still usable for navigation and able to provide feedback.</li>
        <li>Provides feedback on selected components and potential issues</li>
        <li>User-friendly and easy to navigate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The final concept meets the set requirements by ensuring product compatibility, providing insight into the most
        important information about components (performance, price-performance ratio, user reviews, and specifications),
        offering recommendations to the user, and being clear and easy to navigate.</p>
      <p>Overall, this concept provides an excellent solution for building custom PCs. The tool is user-friendly and
        integrates well with the existing Tweakers Pricewatch platform. The various features and states of the tool
        ensure that users can build a custom PC that meets their needs while minimizing screen space and providing
        feedback along the way.</p>
      <h4>Prototype & Validation</h4>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/5.png" alt="A screenshot of the prototype as of its latest iteration.">
      <p>Using my strong foundation in front-end code, I was able to quickly create a testable prototype. The tool is
        inherently non-linear, and there are countless ways to use and navigate through it. With a programmatic
        approach, I can test and demonstrate a large number of scenarios with my prototype.</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" href=".\assets\pc-builder-prototype\index.html">Try the prototype by clicking here!</a></p>
      <p>Creating and providing a prototype that closely resembles the final implementation allowed me to gain
        valuable
        insights, both qualitative and quantitative, during the project's validation phase.</p>
      <h5>Validation</h5>
      <p>I conducted a validation process for the PC Builder tool through two test rounds and a final validation with a
        larger sample size to improve the tool's usability, compatibility check, and component information provision.
        Two
        respondents tested the first version, and their feedback was used to find major areas for improvement. After
        brainstorming solutions, a second test round with two different respondents indicated a more positive user
        experience. The final version was validated by a larger sample size of 176 respondents, with feedback showing
        that
        the tool was well-received and fulfilled users' needs, especially the price-to-performance ratio indication.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/16.png"
        alt="After the initial round of testing, I brainstormed some quick and simple solutions for the identified issues. This image shows my first idea, which involved using call-to-action prompts to guide users through the error correction process.">
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/15.png"
        alt="Users were especially enthusiastic about the price-to-performance ratio indication, proving it to be a well worthy addition.">
      <h4>Future Considerations</h4>
      <h5>Potential Impact</h5>
      <p>Implementing the PC builder tool on the Pricewatch page of Tweakers is reasonably expected to have a positive
        impact on revenue
        generation through increased referral links. The tool is likely to enhance users' confidence in their purchase
        decisions, resulting in more convenient and informed decision-making, thereby leading to more referral links.
      </p>
      <h5>Feasability</h5>
      <p>To realize the concept, I learned from talking to stakeholders that Tweakers will need to invest in making
        the
        current existing product data more suitable for the tool. While the concept is
        technically feasible, a considerable investment may be necessary. Additionally, there will always be edge
        cases
        where the tool may not prevent all errors. The client needs to prepare for such scenarios, where users may try
        to hold them accountable for any damages caused.</p>
      <h5>Recommendations</h5>
      <ul>
        <p>As a result of the usability tests and validation, I recommend Tweakers do the following when implementing
          the
          PC builder feature:</p>
        <li>Implement A/B testing for a clearer button or interaction to add a component to a list.</li>
        <li>Explore ways to increase the authority of "Best Buy Guide" recommendations, such as displaying author
          names
          or linking to articles.</li>
        <li>Make the lists shareable to allow users to share them with friends and family.</li>
        <li>Show performance and price-performance ratio in the Pricewatch component list to enable better comparison
          before adding a component to a configuration.</li>
        <li>Consider implementing a toggle to filter out incompatible choices, as many users expressed a preference
          for
          not seeing incorrect choices at all.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By implementing these changes, the client can make the tool more user-friendly, increase the authority of the
        recommendations, and enable users to share their configurations with others. These changes would ultimately
        lead
        to better user satisfaction and higher conversion rates.</p>
      <h4>Client Feedback</h4>
      <blockquote cite="Bozhan Chipev, Senior UX designer at Tweakers">
        <p>As a UX designer at Tweakers and the supervisor of the internship programme at
          the company, I would say that the PC Builder feature that Arthur designed and
          prototyped is complete and fulfils all requirements we set at the beginning of the
          project. The user journey is clear, there are helpful error messages and warnings
          along the way, components have clearly indicated empty and filled states, and the
          entire interaction has a clear end goal.</p>
        <p>The success of the prototype I find is largely due to the rigorous research and testing
          process that Arthur applied to his project. The fact he designed and developed the
          tool iteratively, testing at each stage, meant that the decisions he took at each turn
          were validated and supported by solid qualitative and quantitative insights. The final
          evaluation of the prototype by the Tweakers community is a testament to this.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
          steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
          the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
          that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
          product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>
