        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a Dutch consumer electronics and
          technology-focused website well known for its community, editorial content, and the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://tweakers.net/smartphones/vergelijken/">Pricewatch</a>, a comprehensive price comparison tool and
          important driver of
          website referals.</p>
        <p>The project stemmed from the premise that Tweakers users, known for their enthusiasm in building PCs, would
          find value in a tool designed to assist them.</p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>As part of my graduation project and internship, I independently managed the end-to-end design process for a conceptual PC
          Builder
          tool. My responsibilities included:</p>
        <ul class="two-col">
          <li>User research</li>
          <li>Market research</li>
          <li>Stakeholder management</li>
          <li>Requirement definition</li>
          <li>Brainstorming</li>
          <li>Wireframing</li>
          <li>Prototyping</li>
          <li>User validation</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tools Used</h3>
        <ul class="two-col">
          <li>Figma</li>
          <li>FigJam</li>
          <li>Google Forms</li>
          <li>Google Meet (Remote interviews and testing)</li>
          <li>Microsoft Teams (Remote interviews and testing)</li>
          <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Prototyping)</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Research Insights</h3>
      <p>User and market research (interviews, surveys, competitive analysis) highlighted the need for a PC building tool and revealed key user motivations, goals, and
        obstacles. It also identified opportunities for Tweakers to leverage its extensive database and expertise in
        computer parts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users are well-seasoned in building PCs, but despite their experience they <strong>still make mistakes,
            picking incompatible components</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Price-performance is, by far, the most important metric to users</strong> when choosing components
        </li>
        <li><strong>Users inform their decisions through recommendations</strong>, ranging from personal connections to
          YouTube
          personalities</li>
        <li>Competitors often feature their tool on a separate page, resulting in a <strong>disjointed user experience
            of
            navigating back and forth between pages.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Competitors lack focus on the Dutch market</strong>, providing incomplete or inaccurate information
          on component availability and pricing</li>
      </ul>

          (N=425, 64.7%

      </figure>
      <h3>Ideation</h3>
      <p>At first I employed sketching and brainstorming techniques like
        Crazy
        Eight to synthesize rough but tangible ideas to meet product requirements.
      </p>

          and

          capabilities.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Further iterative and higher fidelity design in Figma highlighted challenges, such as meeting the requirements
        within limited screen space, balancing information density, and maintaining alignment with Tweakers' design
        system.</p>

      <h3>Validation</h3>
      <h4>Initial Findings</h4>
      <p>Usability tests helped gather initial
        feedback from participants, as well as discover the low-hanging fruit regarding usability and discoverability.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The tool was <strong>collapsed by default, significantly hurting its discoverability</strong>; participants
          would not even
          open the tool unprompted</li>
        <li>The tool <strong>didn't prevent user error</strong>, but would only correct the users afterwards</li>
        <li>The tool also <strong>didn't provide the participants with a next step after an error was made</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/22.png"
          alt="Screenshot of an addition made to the tool after usability tests, providing feed forward of a component's incompatibility.">
        <figcaption>Feed forward as a result of the first usability tests â€” giving incompatible components on the
          Pricewatch a warning symbol
          in
          the product list.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>Outcome</h4>
      <p>
        The final iteration addressed the identified problems, with the following improvements evident during later
        testing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>With the tool expanded by default, <strong>participants immediately discovered the tool</strong> and
          started using it</li>
        <li>Partipants approached their scenario of building a PC much more smoothly thanks to the <strong>feed forward
            highlighting the correct choices.</strong></li>
        <li>Participants were much more positive about the tool in general, <strong>they found the user experience
            smooth and easy to use</strong></li>
        <li>The particpants left me with a few more additions to consider, such as <strong>being able to share the list
            with family or friends.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Solution</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Provides valuable <strong>insights into what users care most about</strong> when choosing components</li>
        <li><strong>Safeguards users from potential mistakes</strong> by providing both feed forward and feedback</li>
        <li>Fill the tool with <strong>editorial recommendations</strong> at the click of a button</li>
        <li>One page solution enabling a <strong>seamless user experience</strong> when browsing and picking components</li>
        <li>Leverages Pricewatch integration to <strong>accurately provide users with the lowest available prices and availability in the Netherlands</strong></li>

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Facilitated easier planning of custom PC builds on the Tweakers website, offering a
          <strong>tailored experience to Dutch and Flemish PC builders compared to foreign
            competitors</strong></li>
        <li>Anticipated <strong>increased usage of referral links</strong> during exploration and purchase finalization
        </li>
        <li>Expected <strong>higher engagement with ad-sponsored editorial content</strong> for informed purchase
          decisions</li>

          <p>...Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
            steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
            the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
            that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
            product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>This was an invaluable experience as a real-world end-to-end design project.
        While conceptual as a graduation project, I remained focused on real-world potential and practicality, for
        instance making sure to investigate the technical feasability as well. </p>
      <p>
        If time had permitted it I would've liked to dive deeper into and learn more about justifying the viability of
        the concept to stakeholders, especially from a business standpoint. I also
        would've liked to expand the scope of the tool and explore more user journeys, for example envisioning of what
        comes after a user saves their component list.</p>
