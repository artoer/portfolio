      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>About Tweakers</h3>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a consumer electronics and
        technology-focused website, specializing in computers. Its revenue model relies on advertising and affiliate
        programs, including the Pricewatch, a prominent price comparison tool for electronics.</p>
      <h3>About the Product</h3>
      <p>I developed a tool for Tweakers designed to assist experienced users in building custom PCs. Integrated into
        the existing Pricewatch functionality, the tool provides insights into price-performance ratios, component
        information, ensures compatibility, and offers recommendations from the Tweakers editorial team.</p>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>As part of my graduation project, I independently managed the end-to-end design process for the PC Builder
        tool. My responsibilities included user research, stakeholder management, requirement definition, brainstorming,
        wireframing, creating a clickable prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and validating the design with
        users.</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Designing a digital tool to assist experienced computer builders involved addressing compatibility issues, user
        preferences, and budget constraints. Identifying user needs and creating a tool that guides them in selecting
        the right components for custom PC builds posed a significant challenge.</p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>A successfully tested clickable prototype of the PC Builder tool, along with conclusive recommendations for
        future implementations.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My strategy included a competitive analysis, user interviews, and surveys to gather insights on existing
        solutions and understand user needs.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/0.png"
        alt="Competitive analysis and inspiration from different approaches, such as LogicalIncrements.">
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/1.png"
        alt='User poll: "What information do you find most important when choosing a PC component?" (N=425, 64.7% prioritize "price-performance ratio").'>
      <p>The insights gathered from a combination of user interviews and surveys shaped the following
        must-have requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compatibility Check:</strong> The tool addresses the common issue of users, even experienced ones,
          overlooking
          incompatibilities during PC builds, potentially resulting in wasted time and money.</li>
        <li><strong>Component Information:</strong> Users prioritize key information such as performance,
          price-performance ratio, user reviews, and specifications when selecting components.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Acknowledging the reliance of users on recommendations, the tool offers
          valuable suggestions during the component selection process.</li>
        <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The tool maintains clarity and user-friendliness, ensuring that users can easily
          navigate and access essential information throughout the process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>During the ideation phase, I employed sketching and brainstorming techniques like Crazy Eight. One particular
        challenge involved finding effective ways to communicate the price-to-performance ratio to users. This led me to
        explore various solutions, combining them into conceptual ideas to address the project requirements.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/8.png"
        alt='Crazy Eight: "How may we provide insight into the compatibility between components?"'>
      <p>Engaging once again with users and stakeholders within Tweakers unearthed surprising new insights, including
        the sequence in which users pick their components and their preferred location for the tool on the website.</p>

      <h2>Iterations</h2>
      <p>Having identified the concept that best aligned with user and stakeholder needs, I advanced to the next phase
        by translating my ideas into concrete designs. Taking my sketches to Figma, I initiated the wireframing process
        to visualize the initial structure of the PC Builder tool.</p>

        alt="Initial wireframe showcasing different states of the tool's interface, serving as a foundation for further development.">
      <p>When the design was ready and possible interactions were accounted for, I transitioned to turning these into a
        prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Leveraging my technical skills to make a prototype that can handle
        various user scenarios during usability testing, making it feel like a real version of the tool.</p>
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/18.png"
        alt="Final version of the clickable prototype, addressing identified issues and incorporating feedback during usability testing.">
      <ul>
        <li>Seamless integration with Tweakers' Pricewatch for custom PC building</li>
        <li>Efficient addition of chosen components with customization options</li>
        <li>Provides valuable insights: performance metrics, power consumption, and potential issues</li>
        <li>Includes editorial recommendations for informed decision-making</li>
        <li>User-friendly features, such as collapsibility for space optimization</li>
        <li>Detailed component information section for thorough overviews</li>
        <li>Accommodates user preferences like resolution-based performance scoring</li>
        <li>Allows exclusion of owned products from price calculations</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Validation</h2>
      <p>Following the iterative design process, I conducted comprehensive testing to refine the PC Builder tool.
        Initial
        feedback from two participants revealed areas for enhancement, such as user engagement and error prevention.
        Subsequent iterations, informed by user insights, addressed these issues, resulting in a more positive second
        testing round.</p>

        alt="Overall impression of the Tweakers community regarding the PC Builder tool (higher is better).">
      <p>
        The tool performed well in overall user satisfaction, notably excelling in presenting performance metrics. To
        ensure sustained user satisfaction and usability, continuous improvement is crucial. Future recommendations
        include A/B testing for clearer interactions, enhancing the visibility of recommendations, enabling list
        sharing,
        and displaying performance metrics in the Pricewatch list. These refinements aim to further elevate the tool's
        functionality and user engagement.</p>
      <blockquote cite="Bozhan, Senior UX designer at Tweakers">
        <p>As a UX designer at Tweakers and the supervisor of the internship programme at
          the company, I would say that the PC Builder feature that Arthur designed and
          prototyped is complete and fulfils all requirements we set at the beginning of the
          project. The user journey is clear, there are helpful error messages and warnings
          along the way, components have clearly indicated empty and filled states, and the
          entire interaction has a clear end goal.</p>
        <p>The success of the prototype I find is largely due to the rigorous research and testing
          process that Arthur applied to his project. The fact he designed and developed the
          tool iteratively, testing at each stage, meant that the decisions he took at each turn
          were validated and supported by solid qualitative and quantitative insights. The final
          evaluation of the prototype by the Tweakers community is a testament to this.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
          steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
          the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
          that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
          product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>
