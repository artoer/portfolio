            I led the end-to-end design of a PC building tool for Tweakers, the
            Netherlands' largest tech community, for my capstone project,
            collaborating with users and stakeholders to create Figma wireframes
            and validate with a hand-coded prototype.

          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p class="large">
            Tweakers users love building PCs, but finding the best-value
            components can be tricky.
          </p>
          <p class="large">
            What if we could help them avoid mistakes and ensure they get the
            most bang for their buck?

          <h4>Process</h4>
            <h2>PC building painpoints</h2>
            <p>
              To understand how Tweakers users build PCs, I reached out and
              interviewed five users while also inviting thousands of Tweakers
              visitors to complete a survey.
            </p>
          <h3>Common mistakes</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Even experienced PC builders make mistakes.</strong> Each
              user had made a mistake at some point building their PC, and the
              frustrating consequences thereof, such as lengthy return
              processes.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <blockquote>
                “...it turned out the component was too small — it was meant for
                a small form factor PC.”
              </blockquote>

            </figure>
          <h3>Power and value</h3>
            <p>
              I also learned a lot about what users think about when choosing
              components,
              <strong
                >price and performance were two key words came up a lot in the
                interviews</strong
              >, and the survey confirmed that
              <strong>
                a staggering 64.7% of Tweakers users prioritize
                price-performance over all else.
              </strong>

            <h2>The competition</h2>
            <p>
              In addition to user research, I analyzed other tools, I saw a
              great amount of inspiration, but also areas where our tool could
              offer a better user experience.
            </p>
          <h3>PCPartPicker</h3>
            <p>
              PCPartPicker does a great job
              <strong>giving feedback on user error</strong>. But
              <strong>
                the user experience was disjointed and lacked oversight</strong
              >, with the overview and different components
              <strong>spread out over multiple pages.</strong>
            </p>
            <img src="./img/pc-builder/pcpartpicker.png" alt="" />
          <h3>Newegg</h3>
            <p>
              On Newegg, the tool took the form of a drawer on the side,
              <strong>
                allowing the user to browse components while keeping track of
                their build—all in one screen.
              </strong>

              <p class="label">Compatibility Check</span>
              <p>
                Ensure compatibility of the eight core PC components so that
                users can't make any mistakes building their PC.

              using HTML, CSS and Javascript and got to usability testing,
              quickly finding low hanging fruit to iterate on, and gauging the
              impressions of users.

              <p class="label">Poor discoverability</span>
              <p>
                The tool was collapsed by default, significantly hurting its
                discoverability; participants would not even open the tool
                unprompted.
              </p>
              <p class="emoji">🛑</span>
              <p class="label">No prevention</span>
              <p>
                The tool didn't prevent user error, but would only warn the user
                <strong>after</strong> making an incompatible choice.
              </p>
              <p class="emoji">👉</span>
              <p class="label">Lack of follow-up</span>
              <p>
                The tool didn't provide the participants with a next step after
                an error was made.
              </p>
          <h3>Iteration</h3>
            <p>
              Back to the drawing board, I sketched several ways to improve feed
              forward and feedback in the tool, as well as provide users a clear
              way to remedy potential errors. For the discoverability, I changed
              the tool to be expanded on default, instead of collapsed.
            </p>
            <img src="./img/pc-builder/omit.png" alt="" />
          <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>
              Checking in with stakeholders, they stressed that they always want
              to be able to see and pick all parts—so instead of hiding or
              disabling incompatible components, the users will keep full
              control, and they'll instead be warned in advance.

            <img src="./img/pc-builder/fix2.png" alt="" />
          <h3>User satisfaction</h3>
            <p>
              The tool performed noticeable better in the follow-up test. The
              tool was easily discovered and users were quick to use it to
              assemble the PCs for their scenarios without error.

                “The tool provides clear information, is easy to use, matches

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              This was an invaluable experience as a real-world, end-to-end
              design project and I'm thankful to Tweakers for the opportunity.
              Hopefully the tool will indeed be implemented one day but I have
              to admit that it would require a lot of buy-in and effort to
              overcome technical contraints.
            </p>
            <p>
              If time had permitted it I would've liked to dive deeper into and
              learn more about justifying the viability of the concept to
              stakeholders, especially from a business standpoint.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also would've liked to expand the scope of the tool and explore
              more user journeys, for example envisioning of what comes after a
              user saves their component list, as that has unfortunately been
              left open ended.
