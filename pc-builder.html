      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a consumer electronics and
        technology-focused website, specializing in computers. Its revenue model relies on advertising and affiliate
        programs, including the <a target="_blank" href="https://tweakers.net/smartphones/vergelijken/">Pricewatch</a>,
        a prominent price comparison tool for electronics and important driver of
        website referals.</p>
      <p>User interviews showed that Tweakers users, while experienced with building PCs, are still prone to mistakes
        and have a desire for more guidance when choosing computer parts.</p>
      <p> As Tweakers boasts an extensive database of PC components and expert knowledge with it's testing lab and
        editorial team, I saw an opportunity to design a tool that fulfills these user needs.</p>
      <!-- <a class="cta" target="_blank" href=".\assets\pc-builder-prototype\index.html">View the prototype<i
          class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> -->
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>As part of my graduation project, I independently managed the end-to-end design process for a conceptual PC
        Builder
        tool. My responsibilities included user research, stakeholder management, requirement definition, brainstorming,
        wireframing, creating a clickable prototype using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and validating the design with
        users.</p>
      <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Needs:</strong> Providing value to Tweakers users, an audience already experienced with
          computers.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Design:</strong> Defining the tool's appearance, positioning within the website, and user
          interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Viability:</strong> Ensuring the backend supports required functionality and availability
          of usable component data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Solution</h2>

        <figcaption>Final version of the clickable prototype, addressing identified issues and incorporating feedback
          during usability testing.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The tool for Tweakers is designed to assist experienced users in building custom PCs. Integrated into
        the existing Pricewatch page, the tool provides insights into price-performance ratios, component
        information, ensures compatibility, and offers recommendations from the Tweakers editorial team.</p>

          class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a>
      <h3>Key features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides valuable insights into what users care most about when choosing components: performance and value
          metrics, key specifications and power consumption</li>
        <li>Safeguards users from potential mistakes by providing both feed forward and feedback during component
          choice, and guides user in resolving these issues or conflicts</li>
        <li>Integration with Tweakers' Pricewatch, leveraging its extensive filters and offering the cheapest
          available
          price alongside the tool</li>
        <li>Fill the tool with editorial recommendations at the click of a button, offering a good starting point for
          users or options to consider</li>
        <li>User-friendly and described as clear and easy to use during usability testing</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Impact</h3>
      <p>By making it easier for users to plan their custom PC builds on the Tweakers website, users will make more use
        of
        referal links as they explore their options or finalize their purchases at web shops, and engage more
        with ad-sponsored editorial content as they seek to further inform their purchase decisions.</p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Discovery</h3>
      <p>Starting out with user interviews shed light on key aspects. It became clear that seasoned PC builders
        prioritize
        maximizing value for their budget. Interestingly, despite their experience, they also shared instances of
        making
        mistakes during the building process.</p>

          <p>For me, by far the most important thing is getting the most bang for my buck.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>I followed up on my findings by conducting a survey on Tweakers, this helped me validate and expand on some
        of
        my earlier insights. For example by asking what users find the most challenging about choosing their
        components.

          (N=425, 64.7%
          prioritize "price-performance ratio").</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Crazy Eight and Figma</h3>
      <p>To begin synthesizing my learnings into a solution I employed sketching and brainstorming techniques like
        Crazy
        Eight, for instance to
        find effective ways to communicate the price-to-performance ratio to users and to find the
        layout, form and positioning that works for Tweakers.

          collapsible overlay on the >Pricewatch page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I brought my ideas and sketches together in Figma, visualizing the first of many high fidelity iterations of
        the tool.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Sketching and wireframing helped highlight the challenges and constraints, such as trying to satisfy various
        user needs within limited screen real estate.
        My iterations focused on balancing information density and clarity,
        while also ensuring that the design as a whole aligned seamlessly with Tweakers.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/14.jpg" alt="">
        <figcaption>The tool's interface several iterations in, incorporating insights from the sketching process and
          stakeholder feedback.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When the design was ready and all possible interactions were accounted for, I leveraged my technical skills
        to
        make a prototype using code, providing a comprehensive non-linear testing environment.</p>
      <h3>User testing</h3>
      <p>With a finished prototype I moved on to user testing to gather initial
        feedback from participants, as well as discover the low-hanging fruit regarding usability and discoverability.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/22.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>One such low hanging fruit was that test participants felt the tool didn't warn them ahead of time
          of
          incompatibilities â€” this was addressed by giving incompatible components on the Pricewatch a warning symbol
          in
          the product list.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The iteration that followed performed significantly better in the follow-up test. The prototype was shared on
        the community forum where the reactions were broadly
        positive.</p>

      <!-- <h3>Final thoughts from my mentor</h3>
      <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a UX designer at Tweakers and the supervisor of the internship programme at
            the company, I would say that the PC Builder feature that Arthur designed and
            prototyped is complete and fulfils all requirements we set at the beginning of the
            project. The user journey is clear, there are helpful error messages and warnings
            along the way, components have clearly indicated empty and filled states, and the
            entire interaction has a clear end goal.</p>
          <p>The success of the prototype I find is largely due to the rigorous research and testing
            process that Arthur applied to his project. The fact he designed and developed the
            tool iteratively, testing at each stage, meant that the decisions he took at each turn
            were validated and supported by solid qualitative and quantitative insights. The final
            evaluation of the prototype by the Tweakers community is a testament to this.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
            steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
            the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
            that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
            product managers have even calculated its commercial viability."</p>
