      <h2>Tweakers</h2>
      <h3>Designing a PC builder, a much-requested feature for the tech-focused Tweakers.net community.</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a popular Dutch consumer electronics
        and technology website, with a strong focus on computers. As a frequent visitor to the website, I noticed a lack
        of tools to help users easily assemble a computer. Currently, users have to research and ensure compatibility of
        each component themselves.</p>
      <p>With the approval of Tweakers, I took it upon myself to explore and design a tool that would help the users of
        Tweakers pick the right parts when building their PCs for my graduation project. In this case study, I will
        outline my process and conclusions in developing a concept, validating it, and providing recommendations for
        future implementation.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/2.png" alt="The front page of Tweakers, featuring articles on tech-related news.">
      <img class="float" src="./img/pc-builder/3.png" alt="The Pricewatch page on Tweakers.">
      <p>Tweakers primarily generates revenue through advertising and affiliate programs that redirect users to other
        webshops. One of the key features of Tweakers is the Pricewatch, which allows users to compare prices of
        electronics across various webshops. Many Tweakers users seek advice and information on computer components
        before purchasing them to replace or build their own desktops.</p>
      <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
      <p>Many computer components have varying compatibility requirements and specifications, making it challenging for
        users to select the right components to build their computer. Additionally, users must consider other factors
        such as performance and budget.</p>
      <h5>Design Challenge</h5>
      <p><strong>"How can we create a digital interactive tool that assists Tweakers users, particularly experienced
          computer
          builders, in selecting the right components for their build?"</strong></p>
      <h5>Sub-Questions</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the needs and preferences of experienced computer builders who use Tweakers?</li>
        <li>How can we design a digital interactive tool that meets the needs of Tweakers users?</li>
        <li>How can the tool assist users in selecting the appropriate components for their build?</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Research</h4>
      <h5>Exploration</h5>
      <p>In the initial phase of the project, I conducted an exploratory competitive analysis to investigate how
        competitors assist users in building a computer. I researched the functionalities that computer builders use on
        the Tweakers website, such as the Pricewatch and Wishlist (Wenslijst in Dutch). The findings of this research
        were utilized in the
        ideation process and were also discussed during interviews.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/0.png"
        alt="Aside from the obvious competitors, I also liked to look at websites that took a different approach such as LogicalIncrements. A website that offers recommendations based on a budget rather than a tool. The website had some interesting ways to display information I took note of.">
      <h5>User Research</h5>
      <p>To better understand the target audience and the customer journey when building a computer, I conducted five
        semi-structured interviews. I discovered that the price-to-performance ratio was the most important factor in
        choosing a component. Gaming was the most common use case. Users relied heavily on recommendations, such as
        guides, reviews, and YouTube videos, for individual components and complete builds. The competing PCPartPicker
        tool was less frequently used due to a lack of Dutch webshop integration. Users mainly kept track of their
        builds using Wordpad lists, shopping carts, or separate browser tabs for each component.</p>
      <p>An important learning
        from the interviews is that while most users I talked to were experienced, they too could make mistakes.</p>
      <blockquote cite="An interviewee">
        <p>...For example, I bought a small-form factor power supply on accident, and it
          turned out the cables were too short to use in my mid-size case.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I also conducted a survey to obtain new insights and validate my earlier research. I shared the survey on the
        Tweakers website's Pricewatch pages for PC components, where my target audience was most accessible. With 425
        respondents, the majority of computer builders were experienced or highly experienced, with over 68.2% having
        built a computer more than four times. The survey validated that the target audience values the
        price-to-performance ratio.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/1.png"
        alt='Poll: "What information do you find most important when choosing a pc component? The vast majority (64.7%) chose "price-to-performance ratio" (N=425).'>
      <h5>Requirements</h5>
      <ul>
        <p>Based on my research I set the following requirements:</p>
        <li>
          <strong>The tool checks product compatibility</strong>
          <p>Despite the audience's extensive experience in assembling computers, they may overlook incompatibilities,
            which can ultimately cost them time and money.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The tool provides insight into the most important information about components</strong>
          <p>According to the audience, the most important information about components is performance and
            price-performance ratio, performance, price, user reviews, and specifications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The tool offers recommendations to the user</strong>
          <p>When assembling computers, the audience often relies on recommendations from others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The tool is clear and easy to navigate</strong>
          <p>The user can easily maintain an overview, and the most important information is visible to the audience.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Ideation & Concept</h4>
      <p>During the ideation phase, I first analyzed the competition to identify best, good, and bad practices. One of
        the best practices that inspired me was Newegg's tool, which was integrated into the product catalog, creating a
        seamless user experience. I also found that tools that efficiently utilized screen space and provided important
        information were good practices, while tools with long and cluttered component lists and inadequate information
        were bad practices.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/7.png"
        alt="During my analysis of good and bad practices, I was greatly inspired by the tool on Newegg, which featured the tool as a sort of overlay on top of a catalogue of products much like Tweakers' Pricewatch.">
      <p>After creating a shortlist of requirements, I brainstormed potential solutions using the "how may we"
        technique, followed by the Crazy Eight method to generate out-of-the-box ideas. I combined the ideas from both
        sessions to create potential concept directions for my project.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/8.png"
        alt='"How may we provide insight into the compatibility between components?" Answered by using the Crazy Eight method. While valueable, in hindsight I should have done this with pen and paper.'>
      <h5>Conceptualizing</h5>
      <p>After the brainstorm session, I intentionally tried to diverge and came up with three conceptual directions
        that were as different from each other as possible, based on the ideas generated and prior insights. I presented
        these directions to both fellow students and stakeholders for feedback. My three concept directions are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>"Overlay" Solution</strong>
          <p>The tool is integrated on the right-hand side of the existing Pricewatch product list
            view. The advantage is that it is technically feasible to integrate the tool within an existing page.
            However,
            the Pricewatch is not specifically designed for building PCs and it may be difficult to translate this
            concept
            to mobile devices.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"Single Page" Solution</strong>
          <p>The tool is limited to a single separate page. Components are chosen from a list that is specific to
            building PCs. The advantage of this concept is that there is enough space to meet the requirements of the
            target audience. The disadvantage is that the information density is very high.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"Dashboard" Solution</strong>
          <p>The user is provided with a user-friendly visual display that supports them in building a computer. The
            advantage of the visual display is its user-friendliness and the overview it can provide. However,
            experienced users may not need this level of support, and the visual elements take up valuable space.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/9.jpg" alt='Concept 3, the "dashboard" solution. As mocked up in the FigJam file.'>
      <h5>Picking a direction</h5>
      <p>To better understand my target audience and justify my choice for a design direction, I reached out to two tech
        journalists who write for Tweakers and conducted a new survey. During the expert interview, the tech journalists
        appreciated the feedback that the tool provided and walked me through their thought process when building a
        computer. They preferred a hybrid form between the first and second design direction, but ultimately found the
        first direction more difficult to translate into a mobile format. They also expressed no interest in visual
        support, so they didn't like the third design direction.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/6.png"
        alt="To help decide on the right concept, I polled the target audience, who seemed to heavily prefer a solution integrated into the Pricewatch. Out of 445 responses, 83.1% of users say that they would rather see a tool that helps them build a pc on the Pricewatch rather than a seperate page in their account of profile.">
      <p>Based on the results of the survey, I found that the target audience preferred the tool to be integrated within
        the Pricewatch environment rather than hidden within their user profile. Considering both the expert interview
        and the survey results, I decided to move forward with the first design direction where the tool is integrated
        into the Pricewatch environment.</p>
      <p>Overall, the expert interview and survey were helpful in gaining a better understanding of my target audience's
        preferences and thought process when building a computer. This information guided my decision for the design
        direction and will help ensure that the final product aligns with the needs and wants of the target audience.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/10.jpg"
        alt='The chosen direction, Concept 1, where the tool is integrated into the Pricewatch page. Shown here is the first iteration mocked up in the FigJam file, the design would later be taken to Figma.'>
      <h4>Design Process</h4>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/11.jpg"
        alt='This is the first iteration of the design in Figma. Note the width, which makes the tool feel cramped. I addressed this issue in later iterations.'>
      <p>The design process involved several iterations with each iteration involving various changes and
        additions to the tool. The first notable change was giving the tool more space by making it as wide as two grid
        columns, in alignment with the design system of Tweakers. The tool also had buttons added to allow users to
        access and adopt
        recommendations from the Tweakers editorial team.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/12.jpg"
        alt='A later iteration, I added the "recommendation" buttons at the top of the tool. At this point, I spent a lot of time fine-tuning the feedback from the tool such as error messages and aligning the elements within the tool to ensure that they were harmonious in every scenario or state.'>
      <p>In the third iteration, I added a summary of the problems with the selected components and included
        warnings under the relevant components to provide a clear understanding of the issues. In addition, the rating
        score of the products was added to give users an idea of how well the chosen components were rated by other
        users.</p>
      <p>In subsequent iterations, I worked on integrating the price-performance ratio into the tool by displaying
        the performance score divided by the price. He experimented with various designs such as tables and icons to
        present the performance score and price-performance ratio in a visually appealing manner. Iteration five saw
        further improvements with the use of icons to convey important information about the components. I also
        added a text link to indicate when more than one component could be selected. In the final iteration, I
        continued refining the icons to improve the overall design of the tool.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/13.png"
        alt='I experimented with showing the performance of components in a table, which would then be placed under a chosen component, but this proved to cause too much bloat.'>
      <h4>Final Concept</h4>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/14.jpg"
        alt='The final iteration in the Figma file showcases the various states and features. The prototype and subsequent iterations would build upon this design.'>
      <p>The tool is designed to be integrated into the existing Tweakers Pricewatch platform, with the aim of providing
        an all-in-one solution for building a custom PC. The tool has several features, including the ability to select
        components, name and save configurations, choose a screen resolution for the performance score, view the power
        consumption, and receive recommendations from Tweakers' Best Buy Guides.</p>
      <p>The tool is also designed to be collapsible to minimize screen space when not in use, and it provides feedback
        on which components have been selected and any potential issues. The collapsed state displays only the selected
        components
        and can be used for navigation to other categories.</p>
      <p>Overall, this concept provides an excellent solution for building custom PCs. The tool is user-friendly and
        integrates well with the existing Tweakers Pricewatch platform. The various features and states of the tool
        ensure that users can build a custom PC that meets their needs while minimizing screen space and providing
        feedback along the way.</p>
      <h4>Prototype & Validation</h4>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/5.png" alt="A screenshot of the prototype as of its latest iteration.">
      <p>Using my strong foundation in front-end code, I was able to quickly create a testable prototype. The tool is
        inherently non-linear, and there are countless ways to use and navigate through it. With a programmatic
        approach, I can test and demonstrate a large number of scenarios with my prototype.</p>
      <a target="_blank" href=".\assets\pc-builder-prototype\index.html">Try the prototype out by clicking here!</a>
      <p>Creating and providing a prototype that closely resembles the final implementation allowed me to gain valuable
        insights, both qualitative and quantitative, during the project's validation phase.</p>
      <h5>Validation</h5>
      <p>The validation process of the PC Builder tool was done through two test rounds and a final validation with a
        larger sample size. The purpose of the validation was to find and improve the "low hanging fruits" of the tool,
        get feedback on the tool's usability, and assess the performance of the tool based on the shortlist criteria.
      </p>
      <p>In the first test round, two respondents tested the first version of the prototype, and their feedback was used
        to find the major areas for improvement. The test revealed that the users did not feel triggered to open the
        tool, leading them to miss out on essential information. Also, the tool only corrected errors after the fact and
        did not offer a follow-up step after making an incorrect selection. I also asked the two respondents to score
        the prototype based on criteria that closely align with the set requirements.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/16.png"
        alt="After the initial round of testing, I brainstormed some quick and simple solutions for the identified issues. This image shows my first idea, which involved using call-to-action prompts to guide users through the error correction process.">
      <p>Following the first test round, I brainstormed possible solutions and iteratively improved the tool.
        The second test round involved two different respondents, and their feedback indicated a more positive user
        experience. Users were notified about incompatible components beforehand and did not make any errors, as opposed
        to the first test round, where they did. The tool was now more accessible, as it was open by default, and the
        test respondents found it easy to use.</p>
      <p>Finally, a larger sample size of 176 respondents validated the final version of the tool. The feedback from the
        sample revealed that the tool was well-received, with 75% of respondents giving a score of 4 or higher for the
        shortlist criteria. The compatibility check and component information features received high scores, indicating
        that the tool fulfilled the users' needs.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/15.png"
        alt="Users were especially enthusiastic about the price-to-performance ratio indication, proving it to be a well worthy addition.">
      <p>In conclusion, the validation process shows that the PC Builder tool had undergone several iterations to
        improve its usability, compatibility check, and information provision for the components. The feedback from the
        larger sample validated that the final version was well-received by the users and fulfilled their needs.</p>
      <h4>Future</h4>
      <h5>Feasability</h5>
      <p>To realize the concept, the client needs to invest in making the data more suitable for the tool. While it is
        technically feasible, a considerable investment may be necessary. Additionally, there will always be edge cases
        where the tool may not prevent all errors. The client needs to prepare for such scenarios, where users may try
        to hold them accountable for any damages caused.</p>
      <h5>Recommendations</h5>
      <p>As a result of the usability tests and validation, I recommend the following for further implementation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement A/B testing for a clearer button or interaction to add a component to a list.</li>
        <li>Explore ways to increase the authority of "Best Buy Guide" recommendations, such as displaying author names
          or linking to articles.</li>
        <li>Make the lists shareable to allow users to share them with friends and family.</li>
        <li>Show performance and price-performance ratio in the Pricewatch component list to enable better comparison
          before adding a component to a configuration.</li>
        <li>Consider implementing a toggle to filter out incompatible choices, as many users expressed a preference for
          not seeing incorrect choices at all.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By implementing these changes, the client can make the tool more user-friendly, increase the authority of the
        recommendations, and enable users to share their configurations with others. These changes would ultimately lead
        to better user satisfaction and higher conversion rates.</p>
      <h4>Client Feedback</h4>
      <blockquote cite="Bozhan Chipev, Senior UX designer at Tweakers">
        <p>As a UX designer at Tweakers and the supervisor of the internship programme at
          the company, I would say that the PC Builder feature that Arthur designed and
          prototyped is complete and fulfils all requirements we set at the beginning of the
          project. The user journey is clear, there are helpful error messages and warnings
          along the way, components have clearly indicated empty and filled states, and the
          entire interaction has a clear end goal.</p>
        <p>The success of the prototype I find is largely due to the rigorous research and testing
          process that Arthur applied to his project. The fact he designed and developed the
          tool iteratively, testing at each stage, meant that the decisions he took at each turn
          were validated and supported by solid qualitative and quantitative insights. The final
          evaluation of the prototype by the Tweakers community is a testament to this.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
          steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
          the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
          that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
          product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>
