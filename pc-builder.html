      <h1>PC Builder Tool for Tweakers.net</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>About the client</h3>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a website that focuses on consumer
        electronics and technology, particularly on computers. Its
        revenue model is mainly through advertising and affiliate programs, such as the Pricewatch, a price comparison
        tool that allows visitors to find the cheapest electronics.</p>
      <h3>About the product</h3>
      <p>I designed a tool for Tweakers which helps the experienced users of the website build custom PCs. The tool is
        integrated into and leverages the existing features of Tweakers' Pricewatch functionality, a well-known price
        comparison tool in the
        Dutch tech community. The tool helps users by giving insight into the price-performance ratio of core components
        and important component information, by ensuring compatibility, and by giving useful feedback every step of the
        way. The tool also leverages the expertise of the Tweakers editorial team by offering recommendations.</p>
      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>I independently managed the end-to-end design process of the tool for Tweakers as part of my graduation
        project. As part of the design process,
        I conducted
        user research, managed the client and stakeholders, defined requirements, brainstormed and wireframed, and
        finally made a clickable prototype and
        validated the design with users.</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>The challenge is to design a digital interactive tool that helps experienced computer builders on Tweakers
        choose the right components, considering the various compatibility issues, user preferences, and budget
        constraints. I need to identify the users' needs and design a tool that can assist them in
        selecting the right components for their custom PC build.</p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>A successfully tested and evaluated clickable prototype of the PC Builder tool, along with my conclusions
        and recommendations for future implementations.</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" href=".\assets\pc-builder-prototype\index.html">Click here to view the protoype.</a></p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>My strategy involved conducting both a competitive analysis and interviews with potential users to gain
        insights on the strengths and weaknesses of existing solutions and better understand user needs and preferences.
        I also conducted a survey to validate my earlier research and obtain new insights, which confirmed that the
        target audience values the price-performance ratio most of all when choosing PC components.</p>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/0.png"
        alt="Aside from the obvious competitors, I also liked to look at websites that took a different approach such as LogicalIncrements. A website that offers recommendations based on a budget rather than a tool. The website had some interesting ways to display information I took note of.">
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/1.png"
        alt='Poll: "What information do you find most important when choosing a PC component?" A significant majority (64.7%) chose "price-performance ratio" (N=425).'>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>I brainstormed potential solutions using the how may we's and the Crazy Eight method which were used to
        generate several concepts. After more user research using a new survey and gathering feedback from stakeholders
        a concept direction was chosen and wireframed further. The wireframe was then made into a clickable, responsive
        prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript to allow convincingly testing an endless number of combinations with
        users.</p>

        alt='Crazy Eight: "How may we provide insight into the compatibility between components?"'>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/6.png"
        alt="The users seemed to prefer a solution integrated into the Pricewatch. Out of 445 responses, 83.1% of users say that they would rather see a tool that helps them build a PC on the Pricewatch rather than a seperate page in their account of profile.">
      <h2>Iterations</h2>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/10.jpg"
        alt="First wireframe of the concept, illustrating the different states of the tool's interface. This early iteration showcases the initial design direction and serves as a foundation for further development and refinement.">
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/11.jpg"
        alt='The inclusion of recommendation buttons, refined feedback messages, and component-specific warnings enhances the user experience by providing a clear understanding of potential issues in the PC build process.'>
      <img src="./img/pc-builder/14.jpg"
        alt="The redesigned tool collects feedback messages in one centralized location, ensuring greater clarity for users. The iteration achieves a more spacious and visually harmonious interface, aligning seamlessly with Tweakers' brand guidelines. Additionally, price-performance information is now conveniently displayed alongside relevant components, aiding users in making informed choices.">

        alt='A screenshot showcasing the final version of the prototype developed with front-end code. This iteration addresses some of the low-hanging fruits identified during testing, including the addition of feed forward to highlight incompatible choices.'>
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>The tool was well-received during usability testing and when the prototype of the tool was made available to
        the Tweakers community, with a lot of praise towards the way the tool provides insight into the
        price-performance ratio of components.</p>
      <p>During validation I identified several potential opportunities to improve the product in the future, from A/B
        tests that might be worth considering to features that can further enrich the user experience, such as the
        ability to share PC builds.</p>
      <p>I would like to conclude this case study with the feedback I received from Bozhan, the senior UX designer at
        Tweakers and major stakeholder.
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="Bozhan, Senior UX designer at Tweakers">
        <p>As a UX designer at Tweakers and the supervisor of the internship programme at
          the company, I would say that the PC Builder feature that Arthur designed and
          prototyped is complete and fulfils all requirements we set at the beginning of the
          project. The user journey is clear, there are helpful error messages and warnings
          along the way, components have clearly indicated empty and filled states, and the
          entire interaction has a clear end goal.</p>
        <p>The success of the prototype I find is largely due to the rigorous research and testing
          process that Arthur applied to his project. The fact he designed and developed the
          tool iteratively, testing at each stage, meant that the decisions he took at each turn
          were validated and supported by solid qualitative and quantitative insights. The final
          evaluation of the prototype by the Tweakers community is a testament to this.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
          steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
          the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
          that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
          product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>
