      <h2>Tweakers</h2>
      <h3>Project PC Builder</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>As a junior UX designer, I was tasked with creating a user-friendly tool to assist experienced PC builders on
        Tweakers, a popular online community for PC enthusiasts, in building their custom PCs. The goal was to design an
        intuitive and efficient user experience that would streamline the process of selecting compatible components and
        provide users with the necessary information to make informed decisions while building their PCs.</p>
      <h4>Challenge</h4>
      <p>The challenge was to create a tool that caters to the needs of experienced PC builders who are knowledgeable
        about PC components and have specific requirements for their custom PCs. These users expect a high level of
        flexibility and customization options in the tool, while also being able to easily compare different components
        and make informed decisions.</p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>To address this challenge, I followed a user-centered design approach, conducting research, prototyping, and
        testing to ensure that the final solution meets the needs of the target users. The final solution, Tweaker's PC
        Builder, is an intuitive and comprehensive tool that guides users through the PC building process, providing
        them with relevant information and recommendations along the way.</p>
      <h4>Research</h4>
      <p>I conducted extensive research to understand the needs and expectations of experienced PC builders on Tweakers.
        This involved conducting user interviews, reviewing forum posts, and analyzing competitor tools. From this
        research, I identified key pain points and opportunities for improvement.</p>
      <p>One of the main pain points identified was the complexity and time-consuming nature of manually selecting
        compatible components. Many users struggled with the technical jargon and the process of cross-referencing
        specifications to ensure compatibility. Another pain point was the lack of clear and reliable information on
        performance, reliability, and user reviews for different components, which made it challenging for users to make
        informed decisions.</p>
      <p>Based on these findings, I defined the following design goals for Tweaker's PC Builder:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Simplify the component selection process: Reduce the complexity and time required to select compatible
          components by providing an intuitive interface that guides users through the selection process.</li>
        <li>Provide relevant and reliable information: Ensure that users have access to accurate and up-to-date
          information on component performance, reliability, and user reviews to support their decision-making process.
        </li>
        <li>Offer customization options: Provide users with the flexibility to customize their PC based on their
          specific requirements, such as budget, performance, and aesthetics.</li>
        <li>Enable easy comparison: Allow users to easily compare different components based on their specifications,
          price, and user ratings.</li>
        <li>Enhance user confidence: Build trust with users by providing clear and concise feedback on their selections
          and recommendations based on their requirements.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Design and Implementation</h4>
      <p>I started the design process by creating low-fidelity wireframes to explore different layout and navigation
        options for the tool. I collaborated with the development team to understand the technical feasibility of the
        design concepts and iterated on the wireframes based on their feedback.</p>
      <p>Once the wireframes were finalized, I created high-fidelity mockups using a modern and clean visual design
        that
        aligned with Tweakers' brand guidelines. I used a consistent color palette, typography, and iconography to
        create a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface.</p>
      <p>The final design of Tweaker's PC Builder consists of the following key features:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Component Selection: The tool provides users with an intuitive interface to select components for their PC
          build, including CPUs, GPUs, RAM, storage, power supplies, and more. Users can filter components based on
          their requirements, such as brand, price, performance, and compatibility. The tool also provides real-time
          feedback on the compatibility of selected components, reducing the risk of users selecting incompatible
          components.
        </li>
        <li>Component Information: Detailed information about each component, including specifications, performance
          benchmarks, user ratings, and reviews, is displayed in a clear and organized manner. Users can easily
          compare different components based on their specifications</li>
        <li>Customization Options: The tool allows users to customize their PC build based on their specific
          requirements, such as budget, performance, and aesthetics. Users can easily swap components in and out, and
          the tool provides real-time feedback on the impact of changes to the overall performance and compatibility
          of the build.</li>
        <li>Comparison View: The tool offers a comparison view that allows users to compare different components side
          by side, making it easy for them to evaluate and select the best options for their PC build. Users can
          compare components based on their specifications, price, performance, and user ratings, making it easier to
          make informed decisions.</li>
        <li>Recommendations and Feedback: The tool provides users with recommendations and feedback based on their
          selected components and requirements. It offers suggestions for alternative components that may better meet
          their needs, and it provides feedback on the compatibility, performance, and reliability of their selected
          components, helping users build their PCs with confidence.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Outcome</h4>
      <p>Tweaker's PC Builder was successfully showcased on the Tweakers website and received positive feedback from the
        community. The intuitive and user-friendly interface of the tool made it easier for experienced PC builders to
        select compatible components, customize their PC builds, and make informed decisions. The tool helped reduce the
        complexity and time required for users to build their custom PCs, and it provided them with reliable information
        and recommendations throughout the process. As a result, Tweaker's PC Builder became a popular tool among the
        Tweakers community, empowering experienced PC builders to create their dream custom PCs with ease.</p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>As a junior UX designer, I am proud to have contributed to the design of Tweaker's PC Builder, a tool that
        empowers experienced PC builders on Tweakers to build their custom PCs with confidence. Through a user-centered
        design approach, I was able to create an intuitive and efficient user experience that simplifies the component
        selection process, provides relevant information, offers customization options, enables easy comparison, and
        enhances user confidence. The successful launch and positive feedback from the community validate the
        effectiveness of the design solution in meeting the needs of the target users and achieving the project goals.
