          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <h2>How to help the experts?</h2>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a Dutch consumer electronics and technology-focused website well known for its community,
            editorial content, and price comparison tool, <a target="_blank" href="https://tweakers.net/televisies/vergelijken/">the Pricewatch</a>.</p> 
          <p>In November 2022, I returned to Tweakers for an internship and my bachelor's graduation project. With Bo's
            support, I proposed a PC builder project to leverage Tweakers' tech focus and vast component database.</p>
          <figure><img src="./img/pc-builder/pricewatch.png" alt="The Tweakers Pricewatch page">
            <figcaption>Tweakers is already popular among PC builders for its focus on tech and powerful price
              comparison tool — The Pricewatch</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Tweakers users already having a high affinity with tech and PCs, the challenge central to this project was:
            How
            may we create a tool that assists Tweakers users, known for their expertise in building PCs, in a way that
            they find valuable?</p>

          <h4>The solution</h4>
          <h2>Intuitive and informed component selection</h2>
          <figure><img src="./img/pc-builder/screens3.png" alt="Close-up of the solution.">

          </figure>
          <h3>Seamless interaction</h3>
          <p>Minimizes the amount of clicks in the user journey and helps users browse various components, while
            offering a complete overview of their PC build.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/pc-builder/2.gif"
              alt="Showcasing how the tool collapses and expands as a side bar, as well as the picking of components and the feedback from the tool.">
            <figcaption>With the tool positioned as a drawer, the user can browse components and view their list within
              the same screen.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>Error prevention</h3>
          <p>Utilizes the existing Tweakers Pricewatch database to check the compatibility between components and helps
            prevent potential user error with feed forward and feedback.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/pc-builder/feedback.png"
              alt="Showing the final iteration of how incompatible components are displayed.">
            <figcaption>Users are warned of choices that are incompatible with other currently chosen components
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>Showing what matters</h3>
          <p>Calculates and shows our power-hungry but thrifty users the price-performance at a glance along with other
            key information such as
            energy consumption</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/pc-builder/26.png"
              alt="Showcasing how users are informed of the performance and price-performance of components.">
            <figcaption>Users can see how well the chosen processor or graphics card performs relative to the price
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>Potential outcome and future</h3>
          <p>At the time of writing the tool has not yet been implemented, and I am no longer employed or interning at
            Tweakers. However I have several hypotheses on how it would impact the business.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased website traffic</strong> by offering a localized experience tailored for Dutch PC builders</li>
            <li><strong>Increased usage of referral links</strong> as users finalize their PC build with partnered web shops</li>
            <li><strong>Higher engagement with ad-sponsored content</strong> such a PC component reviews and guides</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On the other hand, the tool would still have to be developed and then maintained, and according to back-end
            development, data would have to be made usable for the tool. Lastly, there might be the occassional bug or
            edge case that may take up development time.</p>

          <h4>The process</h4>
          <h2>Initial interviews and survey</h2>
          <h3>Painpoints</h3>
          <p>Eager to know more about how Tweakers users build PCs, I reached out and interviewed five users. Four out
            of five users were all indeed very experienced, having built three, four or even more PCs in
            their lives.</p>
          <aside>
            <p>...I completely overlooked that the power supply was meant for a
              small form factor PCs</p>
          </aside>
          <p> But what surprised me the most is that despite their experience, they all had an anecdote to
            share about something they overlooked when they built their PC and the frustrating consequences thereof,
            such as <strong>the lengthy return processes and being unable to use the PC until they have the right part.</strong></p>
          <h3>Priorities</h3>
          <p>Questioning how Tweakers users built their PCs, two words especially stood out to me as <strong>a trend:
            price and performance.</strong> It became clear why when I asked what they used their PCs for; gaming and the
            occassional 3D modeling, both very <strong>power-hungry use cases.</strong></p>
          <aside>
            <p>64.7% of Tweakers users prioritize price-performance over all else</p>
          </aside>
          <p>Launching a survey to triangulate my interview findings, I received 425 responses that confirmed that
            Tweakers users have plentiful experience building PCs, and that they indeed <strong>prioritize price and performance
            most
            of all.</strong></p>

          <h2>The competition</h2>
          <p>Comparing and analysing other tools, I saw a great amount of inspiration, but also things that could be
            better. What especially irked me about a tool like PCPartPicker is that <strong>you had to constantly jump from page
            to page as
            you built your pc.</strong></p>
          <figure>

          </figure>
          <p>On one hand dedicating an entire page for processors allows for in depth browsing, but <strong>I felt like there
            had to be a way to retain the overview.</strong></p>

            <img src="./img/pc-builder/newegg.png" alt="A screenshot of Newegg, showcasing its own PC Builder">
            <figcaption>Newegg.com - with their PC builder tool on the right</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>I saw a potential solution on Newegg, where <strong>the tool took the form
            of a drawer on the side for the PC build as the user browsed components.</strong> Noting the similarities between
            Newegg's store page and Tweaker's Pricewatch, this design direction was very influential to me.</p>

      <section>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Feedback and narrowing scope</h2>
          <p>Wireframing early concept directions in FigJam provided a starting point and a great
            discussion piece
            when engaging with users and stakeholders.</p>

          </figure>
          </figure>
          <p>Doing my rounds with stakeholders, I gathered several valuable insights as I converged towards a solution.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The editorial writers specialized in PCs provided valuable insights and feedback that helped guide the
              information architecture of the tool, and <strong>expressed their preference for Pricewatch integration as PC
              builders.</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <aside>
            <p>The processor is the first choice for many—With retailers even using them as loss leaders</p>
          </aside>
          <ul>
            <li>Back-end development enlightened me about the feasability of a compatibility check using the existing
              Pricewatch data — and while feasible — <strong>I unfortunately learned it wouldn't be easy.</strong></li>
            <li>The head of the component testing lab made several valuable suggestions onhow to display a
              price-performance ratio, and  <strong>confirmed the existence of standardized performance scores.</strong></li>
            <li>The product team exchanged valuable feedback and suggestions to enhance the project, for example
              encouraging me to <strong>focus on the core components to simplify the experience.</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>An additional user survey, yielding 445 responses, helped me hone in on the design direction, supported
            conversations I had with stakeholders, and validated some important assumptions.</p>

          <h2>Sketch, iterate, prototype</h2>
          <p>Utilizing the existing design system, I worked towards a higher fidelity design in Figma, balancing
            requirements and
            information density and incorporating stakeholder feedback with each iteration.</p>

          <p>Once finished, I made the prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript, allowing me create a non-linear testing
            environment with complex logic, which suits the nature of the tool well.</p>

          <p>The first round of usability testing was mixed, overall the tool performed okay, but there were still a few
            critical points of improvement for the tool, thankfully these were all fairly remediable.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The tool was <strong>collapsed by default, significantly hurting its discoverability</strong>;
              participants
              would not even
              open the tool unprompted</li>
            <li>The tool <strong>didn't prevent user error</strong>, but would only correct the users afterwards</li>
            <li>The tool also <strong>didn't provide the participants with a next step after an error was made</strong>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Final iteration</h2>
          <p>Back to the drawing board, I sketched several ways to improve feed forward and feedback in the tool, as
            well as provide users a clear way to remedy potential errors.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/pc-builder/omit.png"
              alt="Showcasing the solution where incompatible components are disabled user interaction.">
            <figcaption>I experimented with both disabling (shown here) and entirely hiding incompatible components at
              first.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>But our expert users insisted on being able to see and pick <em>all parts</em>. Given that most
            incompatibilities can be resolved in more than one way (either swap part A <em>or</em> part
            B), it was logical keep all options open, as long as I made sure users are well aware of potential
            configuration issues.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/pc-builder/fix.png"
              alt="Showcasing attempts to provide feed forward and feedback on component choice.">
            <figcaption>The error now includes a follow-up action towards a solution (left) and users are now warned
              before
              picking components to prevent this in the first place (right)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>In the follow-up tests the tool performed noticeably better, the second round of participants smoothly
            moving through
            the scenarios I prepared for them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>With the tool expanded by default, <strong>participants immediately discovered the tool</strong> and
              started using it</li>
            <li>Partipants approached their scenario of building a PC much more smoothly thanks to the <strong>feed
                forward
                highlighting the correct choices.</strong></li>
            <li>Participants were much more positive about the tool in general, <strong>they found the user experience
                smooth and easy to use</strong></li>
            <li>The particpants left me with a few more recommendations to consider, such as <strong>being able to share
                the list
                with family or friends.</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <aside>
            <p>The tool provides clear information, is easy to use, matches Tweakers' style, and worked smoothly without
              any clutter or distractions</p>
          </aside>
          <h3>User scores</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>3.9 out of 5</strong> — For the tool's prevention and resolution of component incompatibilities
            </li>

          <h4>Closing</h4>
          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>This was an invaluable experience as a real-world, end-to-end design project and I'm thankful to Tweakers
            for the opportunity. Hopefully the tool will indeed be implemented one day but I have to admit that it would
            require a lot of buy-in and effort to overcome technical contraints.
            <p>
              If time had permitted it I would've liked to dive deeper into and learn more about justifying the
              viability
              of
              the concept to stakeholders, especially from a business standpoint.</p>
            <p>
              I also would've liked to expand the scope of the tool and explore more user journeys, for example
              envisioning
              of what comes after a user saves their component list, as that has unfortunately been left open ended.</p>
            <h3>Mentor's afterword</h3>
            <figure class="quote">
              <blockquote>
                <p>...Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next

                  the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. <span>The handover is in fact so complete,
                  that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
