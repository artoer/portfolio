      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a consumer electronics and
        technology-focused website, specializing in computers. Its revenue model relies on advertising and affiliate
        programs, including the <a target="_blank" href="https://tweakers.net/smartphones/vergelijken/">Pricewatch</a>,
        a prominent price comparison tool for electronics and important driver of
        website referals.</p>
      <p>User interviews showed that Tweakers users, while experienced with building PCs, are still prone to mistakes
        and have a desire for more guidance when choosing computer parts.</p>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>As part of my graduation project, I independently managed the end-to-end design process for a conceptual PC
          Builder
          tool. My responsibilities included:</p>
        <li>User research</li>
        <li>Stakeholder management</li>
        <li>Requirement definition</li>
        <li>Brainstorming</li>
        <li>Wireframing</li>
        <li>Prototyping</li>
        <li>User validation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tools used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Figma</li>
        <li>FigJam</li>
        <li>Google Forms</li>
        <li>Microsoft Teams and Google Meet (Remote interviews and usability testing)</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Prototyping)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Needs:</strong> Providing value to Tweakers users, an audience already experienced with
          computers.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Design:</strong> Defining the tool's appearance, positioning within the website, and user
          interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Viability:</strong> Ensuring the backend supports required functionality and availability
          of usable component data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/18.png" alt="Screenshot showing the final iteration of the prototype">
        <figcaption>Final version of the clickable prototype as handed over to Tweakers, addressing identified issues
          and insights
          gathered from usability tests.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <a class="cta" target="_blank" href=".\assets\pc-builder-prototype\index.html">View the prototype<i
          class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a>
      <p>The tool for Tweakers is designed to assist experienced users in building custom PCs. Integrated into
        the existing Pricewatch page, the tool provides insights into price-performance ratios, component
        information, ensures compatibility, and offers recommendations from the Tweakers editorial team.</p>
      <h3>Key features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides valuable insights into what users care most about when choosing components</li>
        <li>Safeguards users from potential mistakes by providing both feed forward and feedback</li>
        <li>Integration with Tweakers' Pricewatch, leveraging its extensive filters and offering the cheapest
          available
          price alongside the tool</li>
        <li>Fill the tool with editorial recommendations at the click of a button, offering a good starting point for
          users or options to consider</li>
        <li>User-friendly and described as clear and easy to use during usability testing</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Impact</h3>
      <p>By making it easier for users to plan their custom PC builds on the Tweakers website, users will make more use
        of
        referal links as they explore their options or finalize their purchases at web shops, and engage more
        with ad-sponsored editorial content as they seek to further inform their purchase decisions.</p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Discovery</h3>
      <p>User interviews validated my assumption and shed led light on key user motivations and goals.</p>
      <figure class="insert">
        <blockquote>
          <p>For me, by far the most important thing is getting the most bang for my buck.</p>
        </blockquote>

      </figure>
      <p>Following up with a survey helped me validate and expand on some of my earlier findings.</p>
      <figure>

          alt="Screenshot showcasing the survey results to the question: 'What do you find most important when choosing a component?', Out of 425 participants, 64.7% answered price-performance ratio.">

          (N=425, 64.7%
          prioritize "price-performance ratio").</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Empathizing</h3>
      <p>The customer journey was mapped, and the identified opportunities and painpoints formed some of the must-have
        requirements.</p>
      <figure> <img src="./img/pc-builder/23.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the customer journey map made in FigJam.">

          currently navigate building a PC.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      </figure>
      <h3>Wireframing</h3>
      <p>At first I employed sketching and brainstorming techniques like
        Crazy
        Eight to synthesize rough but tangible ideas to meet product requirements.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/22.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a crazy eight brainstorming excercise showcasing the first sketch of the concept.">

          excercise.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sketches and ideas came together in Figma, forming an early concept.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/21.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the concept at an early stage, wireframed in FigJam.">

          stakeholders.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Further iterative wireframing in Figma highlighted challenges like meeting diverse user needs within limited
        screen space, balancing information density, and maintaining alignment with Tweakers' design system.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/14.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the concept at a later stage, a higher fidelity design in Figma.">
        <figcaption>The tool's interface several iterations in, incorporating insights from the sketching process and
          stakeholder feedback.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When the design was ready and all possible interactions were accounted for, I leveraged my technical skills
        to
        make a prototype using code, providing a comprehensive non-linear testing environment.</p>
      <h3>Validation</h3>
      <p>Usability tests helped gather initial
        feedback from participants, as well as discover the low-hanging fruit regarding usability and discoverability.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/22.png" alt="Screenshot of an addition made to the tool after usability tests, providing feed forward of a component's incompatibility.">
        <figcaption>One such low hanging fruit was that test participants felt the tool didn't warn them ahead of time
          of
          incompatibilities â€” this was addressed by giving incompatible components on the Pricewatch a warning symbol
          in
          the product list.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The iteration that followed performed significantly better in the follow-up test, and the completed prototype
        was received positively on the community forum.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/19.png" alt="Screenshot of a survey result, where Tweakers users could score their general impression of the tool. 47.7% gave it a 4 out of 5, 26.8% gave it a 5 out of 5.">
        <figcaption>Overall impression of the Tweakers community regarding the PC Builder tool (higher is better).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Handover</h3>
      <p>With my graduation project complete, I left Tweakers with a robust and validated prototype and documentation
        that they can build upon in the future.</p>
      <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          <p>...Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
            steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
            the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
            that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
            product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>
