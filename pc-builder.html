    <div id="content">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweakers.net/">Tweakers.net</a> is a Dutch consumer electronics and
        technology-focused website well known for its community, editorial content, and the <a target="_blank"
          href="https://tweakers.net/smartphones/vergelijken/">Pricewatch</a>, a comprehensive price comparison tool and
        important driver of
        website referals.</p>

      <p>The project stemmed from the premise that Tweakers users, known for their enthusiasm in building PCs, would
        find value in a tool designed to assist them.</p>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <ul class="two-col">
        <p>As part of my graduation project, I independently managed the end-to-end design process for a conceptual PC
          Builder
          tool. My responsibilities included:</p>
        <li>User research</li>
        <li>Stakeholder management</li>
        <li>Requirement definition</li>
        <li>Brainstorming</li>
        <li>Wireframing</li>
        <li>Prototyping</li>
        <li>User validation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tools Used</h3>
      <ul class="two-col">
        <li>Figma</li>
        <li>FigJam</li>
        <li>Google Forms</li>
        <li>Google Meet (Remote interviews and testing)</li>
        <li>Microsoft Teams (Remote interviews and testing)</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Prototyping)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Needs:</strong> Providing value to Tweakers users, an audience already experienced with
          computers.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Design:</strong> Defining the tool's appearance, positioning within the website, and user
          interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Viability:</strong> Ensuring the backend supports required functionality and availability
          of usable component data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Discovery</h3>
      <p>User interviews validated my assumption and shed led light on key user motivations and goals.</p>
      <figure class="insert">
        <blockquote>
          <p>For me, by far the most important thing is getting the most bang for my buck.</p>
        </blockquote>

      </figure>
      <p>Following up with a survey helped me validate and expand on some of my earlier findings.</p>

          (N=425, 64.7%
          prioritize "price-performance ratio").</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Translating Painpoints into Requirements</h3>
      <figure> <img src="./img/pc-builder/23.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the customer journey map made in FigJam.">
        <figcaption>The customer journey map, shaped by earlier user research, empathically showing how Tweakers users
          currently navigate building a PC.</figcaption></figure>
      <ul>
        <p>Based on my findings the customer journey was mapped, revealing opportunities and painpoints that informed
          the
          must-have
          requirements:</p>
        <li>Ensure component compatibility, addressing a common pain point identified during discovery</li>
        <li>Provide key component information, such as price-performance, which users highly value</li>
        <li>Offer user recommendations, recognizing that users often rely on authoritative guidance</li>
        <li>Prioritize user-friendliness, emphasizing intuitive design and usability</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Stakeholder Follow-up</h3>
      <p>After reflecting on the requirements, I made sure to interview key stakeholders such as Tweakers editorial writers,
        component testers, and back-end developers, providing additional perspectives, technical insight and inspiration as I began working on a solution.
      </p>

        <figcaption>One challenge was determining the technical viability of the price-performance ratio. During
          interviews the head of the test lab pointed out that they record standardized performance scores, which I based the price-performance score in the tool off.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Ideation and Prototyping</h3>
      <p>At first I employed sketching and brainstorming techniques like
        Crazy
        Eight to synthesize rough but tangible ideas to meet product requirements.
      </p>

          excercise.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sketches and ideas came together in Figma, forming an early concept.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/21.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the concept at an early stage, wireframed in FigJam.">
        <figcaption>Early concepts were mocked up in FigJam and used to gather feedback from
          stakeholders.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Further iterative wireframing in Figma highlighted challenges like meeting diverse user needs within limited
        screen space, balancing information density, and maintaining alignment with Tweakers' design system.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/14.jpg"
          alt="Screenshot of the concept at a later stage, a higher fidelity design in Figma.">
        <figcaption>The tool's interface several iterations in, incorporating insights from the sketching process and
          stakeholder feedback.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When the design was ready and all possible interactions were accounted for, I leveraged my technical skills
        to
        make a prototype using code, providing a comprehensive non-linear testing environment.</p>
      <h3>Validation</h3>
      <p>Usability tests helped gather initial
        feedback from participants, as well as discover the low-hanging fruit regarding usability and discoverability.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/22.png"
          alt="Screenshot of an addition made to the tool after usability tests, providing feed forward of a component's incompatibility.">
        <figcaption>One such low hanging fruit was that test participants felt the tool didn't warn them ahead of time
          of
          incompatibilities â€” this was addressed by giving incompatible components on the Pricewatch a warning symbol
          in
          the product list.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The iteration that followed performed significantly better in the follow-up test, and the completed prototype
        was received positively on the community forum.</p>
      <figure>

          class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a>
      <p>As a drawer on
        the Pricewatch page, the tool provides insights into price-performance ratios, component
        information, ensures compatibility, and offers recommendations from the Tweakers editorial team.</p>
      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides valuable insights into what users care most about when choosing components</li>
        <li>Safeguards users from potential mistakes by providing both feed forward and feedback</li>
        <li>Integration with Tweakers' Pricewatch, leveraging its extensive filters and price tracking across popular Dutch web shops</li>
        <li>Fill the tool with editorial recommendations at the click of a button, offering a good starting point for
          users or options to consider</li>
        <li>User-friendly and described as clear and easy to use during usability testing</li>
        <li>Responsively designed and validated for both desktop and mobile use</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/pc-builder/25.png" alt="Screenshot showcasing the mobile view of the solution.">
        <figcaption>Mobile view of the solution, demonstrating navigation between the tool and Pricewatch through a

      </figure>
      <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
      <p>By making it easier for users to plan their custom PC builds on the Tweakers website, I anticipate that users will make more use
        of
        referal links as they explore their options or finalize their purchases at web shops, and engage more
        with ad-sponsored editorial content as they seek to further inform their purchase decisions.</p>
      <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          <p>...Lastly, the final version of the prototype Arthur leaves us with, and the list of next
            steps he has devised, together represent the first major milestone towards delivering
            the PC Builder feature to all Tweakers users. The handover is in fact so complete,
            that our development team is eager to get started on implementation before our
            product managers have even calculated its commercial viability.</p>
