      <p>As a UX designer, I've always been fascinated by the
        digital world of websites, games, and apps. From a young
        age, I experimented with website builders and Photoshop CS2, and even designed levels for games like
        Counter-Strike. These experiences sparked my passion for creating intuitive, user-friendly digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p>As a recent graduate of Communication and Multimedia Design, I have developed a strong skill set in solving
        complex
        problems using research, data analysis, and pixel-perfect design. Whether it's crafting a seamless user journey
        or
        designing a beautiful interface, I am passionate about creating meaningful experiences that delight users.</p>
      <p>When I'm not behind a screen, I love immersing myself in games and TV series with compelling narratives and
        rich
        worlds. And when I'm feeling adventurous in the kitchen, you'll often find me whipping up Tex-Mex dishes.</p>
