      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>Passionate about digital design and UX, I graduated with Honors in Communication and Multimedia Design and
        excelled in a year of internships. With hands-on experience in design, user research, and prototyping, I deliver
        impactful solutions through a blend of design skills, empathic research, and technical proficiency.</p>
      <p>Other passions include cooking, keeping up and tinkering with tech, getting lost in video games and
        TV shows, savoring good food, exploring new places, and enjoying Formula 1 and football (soccer ðŸ˜‰).</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Arthur is an excellent UX designer with a really strong affinity for prototyping. His technical skills
            supplement his design education and he has proven himself extremely capable time and time again - from
            building A/B tests to putting together entire clickable prototypes for user testing. I enjoyed tremendously
            managing Arthur during his two internships at Tweakers.net - he is eager to learn, motivated, and an
            incredibly fast worker.</p>
