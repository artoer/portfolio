      <p>As a UX designer, I've always been fascinated by the digital world of websites, games, and apps. From a young
        age, I experimented with website builders and Photoshop CS2, and even designed levels for games like
        Counter-Strike. These experiences ignited my interest in the field of UX design and drove me to pursue it as a career.
      </p>
      <p>Creating intuitive, user-friendly digital experiences is my passion. I am skilled in
        conducting user research, creating wireframes and prototypes, and designing engaging interactions and interfaces
        that align with user needs. My technical knowledge allows me to develop lifelike prototypes and tests and work
        collaboratively with developers to bring designs to life. I am dedicated to crafting seamless user journeys and
        designing beautiful interfaces that make an impact.</p>
      <p>When I'm not behind a screen, I love immersing myself in games and TV series with compelling narratives and
        rich worlds. And when I'm feeling adventurous in the kitchen, you'll often find me whipping up Tex-Mex dishes.
