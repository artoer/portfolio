          <h2>Hi! I'm Arthur</h2>
          <p> <img class="profile-pic" src="./img/me.png" alt="">Passionate about digital design and UX, I graduated
            with Honors in Communication and Multimedia Design and
            excelled in a year of internships. With hands-on experience in design, user research, and prototyping, I
            deliver
            impactful solutions through a blend of design skills, empathic research, and technical proficiency.</p>
          <p>Other passions include cooking, keeping up and tinkering with tech, getting lost in video games and
            TV shows, savoring good food, exploring new places, and enjoying Formula 1 and football (soccer ðŸ˜‰).</p>
          <p>To get in touch, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-menken/" target="_blank">connect with me on
              LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:arthur_menken@hotmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Arthur is an excellent UX designer with a really strong affinity for prototyping. His technical skills
                supplement his design education and he has proven himself extremely capable time and time again - from
                building A/B tests to putting together entire clickable prototypes for user testing. I enjoyed
                tremendously
                managing Arthur during his two internships at Tweakers.net - he is eager to learn, motivated, and an
                incredibly fast worker.</p>

              <p>Arthur completed an internship and graduation project with us. In both, he demonstrated the broad
                skills that a
                modern UX designer should have. He can design, conduct user research, and also has the technical ability
                to
                independently build A/B tests and prototypes. It was a pleasure to have him on the team.</p>

              <p>Happy to give my recommendation for Arthur. I mentored him during his CRO/UX internship at Talpa
                eCommerce. He
                has knowledge of various aspects of the CRO/UX process: especially research, designing and coding, which
                makes
                it easy for him to get along quickly. You can rely on Arthur to get things done!</p>
