          <h2>Hallo! I'm Arthur</h2>
          <h3>Aspiring UX Designer from Holland</h3>
          <p>Ever since I could sit behind a desktop I found myself fascinated by the digital world of websites,
            games and apps. I experimented a lot and challenged my ingenuity.
            From playing with so-called website builders and Photoshop CS2 to designing levels for games such as
            <em>Counter-Strike.</em></p>
          <p>Nowadays I'm in my fourth year of Communication & Multimedia Design. I like solving challenging problems by
            using research, hard
            data and the pushing of lots and lots of pixels.</p>
          <p>In my free time I like to enjoy games and TV series with good stories and immersive worlds.
            I also like to experiment in the kitchen when I'm not behind a screen, I am especially fond of Tex-Mex.
