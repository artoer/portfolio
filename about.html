          <p>I fell in love with UX Design because of its unique intersection between creativity, empathy, tech, and
            craft. I've had the pleasure to hone my skills and versatility during internships at Tweakers and Talpa
            eCommerce, two major players in Dutch tech media and ecommerce respectively, as well as graduating with
            honors in Communication and Multimedia Design. These experiences solidified my passion for impactful
            user-centered design.</p>
          <p>Other passions include cooking, keeping up and tinkering with tech, getting lost in video games and
            TV shows, savoring good food, exploring new places, and enjoying Formula 1 and soccer.</p>

            <p><span>Arthur is an excellent UX Designer with a really strong affinity for prototyping.</span> His
              technical
              skills
              supplement his design education and he has proven himself extremely capable time and time again - from
              building A/B tests to putting together entire clickable prototypes for user testing. I enjoyed
              tremendously
              managing Arthur during his two internships at Tweakers.net - he is eager to learn, motivated, and an
              incredibly fast worker.</p>

            <p>Arthur completed an internship and graduation project with us. In both, <span>he demonstrated the broad
                skills that a
                modern UX Designer should have.</span> He can design, conduct user research, and also has the technical
              ability
              to
              independently build A/B tests and prototypes. It was a pleasure to have him on the team.</p>

            <p>Happy to give my recommendation for Arthur. I mentored him during his CRO/UX internship at Talpa
              eCommerce. He
              has knowledge of various aspects of the CRO/UX process: especially research, designing and coding,
              which
              makes
              it easy for him to get along quickly. <span>You can rely on Arthur to get things done!</span></p>
