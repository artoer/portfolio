    <h1>About me: Arthur Menken</h1>
    <div class="heading">
      <h2>Hallo! I'm Arthur</h2>
      <h3>Emerging & Versatile UX Designer</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>As a UX designer, I've always been fascinated by the digital world of websites, games, and apps. From a young
        age, I experimented with website builders and Photoshop CS2, and even designed levels for games like
        Counter-Strike. My experimentation with website builders and design software at a young age laid the foundation
        for my passion for creating digital experiences that are user-friendly and intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>My skills and passion lie in conducting user research, creating wireframes and prototypes, and designing engaging interactions and interfaces
        that align with user needs. My technical knowledge allows me to develop lifelike prototypes and tests, and work
        collaboratively with developers to bring designs to life. I am dedicated to crafting seamless user journeys and
        designing beautiful interfaces that leave a lastic impact.</p>
      <p>When I'm not behind a screen, I love immersing myself in games and TV series with compelling narratives and
        rich worlds. And when I'm feeling adventurous in the kitchen, you'll often find me whipping up Tex-Mex dishes.
      </p>
