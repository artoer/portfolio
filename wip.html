      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>During my internship at Tweakers, I had the opportunity to contribute to the redesign of the website according
        to the new design system spearheaded by my supervisor, who also served as the UX Designer. This involved
        implementing a responsive grid of up to 4 columns, necessitating careful
        consideration and experimentation in presenting various elements.</p>
        <h3>My role</h3>
      <p> My specific focus was on revamping the <a href="https://tweakers.net/reviews/" target="_blank">review
          portal</a> and the <a href="https://tweakers.net/smartphones/reviews/" target="_blank">review listings</a>.
        Aligning my designs with
        the newly developed design system and grid, I took into account user behavior, preferences, and ensured
        responsiveness for smaller screen sizes. Surveys and data analysis of page interactions were integral in guiding
        these informed design decisions.</p>
      </p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>To determine the priority content for the redesign, we conducted surveys to understand what users considered
        important in the current situation. Additionally, I collaborated with the Product Owner to analyze user
        interactions on the page, adopting a data-driven design approach.</p>

      <h3>Sketches &amp; Prototypes</h3>
      <p>My design process started with lo-fi sketches, exploring and experimenting with the right composition within
        the grid.</p>

      <p>Designing for a widescreen format of 4 columns, as well as smaller screens (3 columns), tablets (2 columns),
        and mobile (1 column wide) posed a significant challenge. Finding a design that looked balanced across all
        screen sizes was crucial.</p>

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>I filled my designs with real content, and the team was satisfied with the final result. Contributing to the
        redesign of Tweakers was a fulfilling experience, and I hope to see my work on the website in the future.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>This was a smaller task that demonstrated the importance of guiding and justifying design choices through
        research and data. Responsive design presented a good challenge, with numerous iterations and feedback
        sessions with the team leading to a satisfying final result.</p>
