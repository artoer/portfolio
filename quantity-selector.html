      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>About the project</h3>
      <p>As an intern at Talpa eCommerce, I was assigned to design a solution for the e-commerce website <a
          target="_blank" href="https://www.actievandedag.nl/">Actie van de Dag</a>, where customers could select the
        quantity of products they wanted to purchase on the product detail page,
        in addition to the shopping cart dropdown. The challenge was to make it work smoothly for mobile devices, with
        limited space in the sticky bottom bar.</p>
      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>As the designer for this project, I took inventory of the current situation, gathered inspiration from
        competitors, designed thoughtfully and iteratively using Sketch, and presented various design options to my team, refining the
        final design based on feedback.</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>The main challenge for this project was designing a solution that would work seamlessly for mobile users, given
        the limited space in the sticky bottom bar, while ensuring that all product options were easily accessible.</p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>Handover ready Sketch designs of the functionality that consider the various scenarios.</p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>I began by taking inventory of the current situation, discovering several factors that complicate simply adding
        a
        quantity selector to the sticky bottom bar on mobile, the main one being products that require some kind of
        choice, such as the color of a curtain or the day of a concert ticket.</p>
      <p>I also researched which design patterns
        other e-commerce websites employ, and finally my I conducted a lot of experimental and iterative design, trying
        out many different design patterns to make the most of the real estate on the page.</p>

        alt="Example of the current situation, note the user can only add one ticket for the zoo to the shopping cart at a time.">
      <h2>Iterations</h2>
      <p>From here, it was an iterative design process in collaboration with my team where many different solutions were
        sketched.</p>
      <img src="./img/quantity-selector/2.png"
        alt="One of the first attempts at a solution, where the price is put into the call-to-action, which frees up space for a quantity selector.">
      <img src="./img/quantity-selector/3.png"
        alt="One of the many variants considered where the options are hidden under a toggle.">
      <img src="./img/quantity-selector/5.png"
        alt="An overview of my Sketch canvas including many different iterations and ways to tackle certain scenarios.">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>For mobile, the final design solution would be to have the price and call-to-action prominently displayed at
        the top of the page, allowing ample space for the button, price, quantity selector, and product options. The
        bottom menu bar would then serve
        as an anchor link to scroll the user towards any options the user would have to select and the price.</p>

        alt="The final design for the sticky bottom bar, shown when the user is scrolled down the page, which now lets the user pick a quantity of products, but will scroll the user to the top of the page if they are required to choose options.">
