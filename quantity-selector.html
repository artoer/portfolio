        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.actievandedag.nl/">Actie van de Dag</a> is a platform owned by Talpa
          eCommerce that specializes in
          selling a variety of discounted products, from furniture and electronics to hotel stays.</p>
        <p>User feedback gathered using Hotjar made it plain users were missing the ability to buy multiples of a
          product
          on the product
          detail page, as right now it was only possible in the shopping cart page.</p>
        <figure class="insert">
          <blockquote>
            <p>How may we best integrate this feature on our existing product page, especially on mobile, with the
              strong assumption that doing so would reduce user friction and improve conversion?</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>My approach began with an assessment of the existing situation, uncovering the constraints and complexities
          in
          adding a
          quantity selector to the sticky bottom bar.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./img/quantity-selector/8.png" alt="Screenshot showcasing the current state of the product page">
          <figcaption>Current situation. Note the sticky bottom bar, containing price and call-to-action, always being
            present
            even when scrolled above the fold. Limiting the addition of complex user interactions such as a quantity
            selector.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>After, I focused on exploring design patterns employed by other e-commerce
          platforms before diving into Sketch.</p>

          <img src="./img/quantity-selector/9.png"
            alt="Screenshot of a dropdown design pattern as used by a competing e-commerce platform">
          <figcaption>During my research I often encountered this dropdown pattern as well, which I tried â€” but decided
            against in favor of the more mobile friendly incremental counter.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Iterations</h3>
        <p>The iterative design process involved collaboration with my team, exploring various solutions through
          sketches
          and prototypes.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./img/quantity-selector/2.png"
            alt="Screenshot showcasing the initial attempt to integrate a quantity selector.">
          <figcaption>Initial attempt: Merging the price into the call-to-action to accommodate a quantity selector, but
            at the unwarranted expense of the cart icon, conciseness and consistency, blunting the call-to-action.

        </figure>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>After iterative rounds and stakeholder feedback with the product owner, UX designer, and CRO specialist, we
          reached a collective decision. We acknowledged the limitations of the sticky bottom bar and opted to
          prioritize
          the call-to-action and quantity selector within it. Simultaneously, we recognized the potential above the fold
          to accommodate more complex interactions and information, while prominently displaying the call-to-action once
          more.</p>
        <h3>Designs</h3>
        <p>My designs mainly focused on three common scenarios, and showcase the situation both above and below
          the fold.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./img/quantity-selector/6.png" alt="Screenshot showcasing the end result">
          <figcaption>Designs illustrating above-the-fold scenarios where users are prompted to make selections or
            choose
            quantities, or when neither action is necessary.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="./img/quantity-selector/7.png" alt="Screenshot showcasing the end result">
          <figcaption>Designs of the sticky bottom bar, appearing upon scrolling down, allowing users to select
            quantities if available. If options are required, users are smoothly scrolled to the top of the page.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The final designs were shared in a Jira ticket, ensuring that they were easily accessible for further
          consideration and implementation by the development team.</p>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p>As a continuation, and partially validating the solution, an A/B test was conducted to assess featuring the
          add-to-cart
          call-to-action both above the
          fold and during scroll. Tracking call-to-action clicks revealed a notable increase, supporting the positive
          impact of this adjustment and suggesting the potential for integrating a quantity selector feature.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./img/quantity-selector/1.gif"
            alt="Animation showcasing an A/B test as the user scrolls below the fold, displaying the behavior of the chosen design direction">
          <figcaption>Showcasing the new behavior for the A/B test, implemented using CSS and JavaScript.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
        <p>It's hypothesized that allowing users to purchase multiples of products earlier in the journey reduces
          friction, resulting in
          increased conversions. This is particularly beneficial for products often sold in multiples, such as concert
          tickets.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This experience taught me the importance of trying different approaches before finding the right solution.
          Collaborating with peers and stakeholders provided valuable feedback. Additionally, working within the
          constraints of mobile-first design emphasized the need to consider alternative solutions and recognize
          limitations.
