      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>About the project</h3>
      <p>As an intern at Talpa eCommerce, I was assigned to design a solution for the e-commerce website <a
          target="_blank" href="https://www.actievandedag.nl/">Actie van de Dag</a>, where customers could select the
        quantity of products they wanted to purchase on the product detail page,
        in addition to the shopping cart dropdown. This addition is important because certain products such as concert tickets
        are often bought in multiples.</p>
      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>As the designer for this project, I took inventory of the current situation, gathered inspiration from
        competitors, designed thoughtfully and iteratively using Sketch, and presented various design options to my
        team, refining the
        final design based on feedback.</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>The main challenge for this project was designing a solution that would incorporate a quantity selector into
        the existing design, which currently consists of a sticky bottom bar on mobile, which offered limited screen
        real estate for such an addition. Furthermore, I had to consider various scenarios, including worst-case ones
        where a product requires choosing several options.</p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>Handover ready Sketch designs of the functionality that consider the various scenarios.</p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>I began by taking inventory of the current situation, discovering several factors that complicate simply adding
        a
        quantity selector to the sticky bottom bar on mobile, the main one being products that require some kind of
        choice, such as the color of a curtain or the day of a concert ticket.</p>
      <p>I also researched which design patterns
        other e-commerce websites employ, and finally I conducted a lot of experimental and iterative design, trying
        out many different design patterns to make the most of the available screen real estate.</p>

        alt="Example of the current situation above the fold, note the user can only add one ticket for the zoo to the shopping cart at a time, and that the price and add-to-cart button is only availalbe inside the sticky bottom bar..">
      <h2>Iterations</h2>
      <p>From here, it was an iterative design process in collaboration with my team where many different solutions were
        sketched.</p>
      <img src="./img/quantity-selector/2.png"
        alt="This initial attempt at a solution involved moving the price into the call-to-action, which allowed space for a quantity selector. However, due to the limited screen real estate, the button became cramped, and the shopping cart icon had to be sacrificed to make it fit.">

        alt='One of the many variants considered where the options are hidden under an "options" toggle that would expand the sticky bottom bar to show the available options.'>
      <img src="./img/quantity-selector/5.png"
        alt="An overview of my Sketch canvas including many different iterations and ways to tackle certain scenarios.">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>For the final design, it was decided to display the options, price, and add-to-cart button at the top of the
        page, in addition to the sticky bottom bar. The sticky bottom bar only appears as the user scrolls below the
        fold, and it now includes a quantity selector and an add-to-cart button. If the user needs to choose one or more
        options, the button will scroll them to the top of the page.</p>
