          <h2>Getting to know the user</h2>
          <p>To understand how Tweakers users build PCs, I reached out and interviewed five users while also inviting
            thousands of Tweakers visitors to complete a survey.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p><strong>Even experienced PC builders make mistakes.</strong> Each user had made a mistake at some point building their PC,
            and
            the frustrating consequences thereof, such as lengthy return processes.</p>

        <div class="col-3">
          <p>I also learned a lot about what users think about when choosing components,
            <strong>price and performance were two key words came up a lot in the interviews</strong>, and the survey confirmed that <strong>
              a
              staggering 64.7% of Tweakers users prioritize price-performance over all else.

            where our tool could offer a better user experience.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>PCPartPicker</h3>

          <p>PCPartPicker does a great job <strong>giving feedback on user error</strong>. But <strong>

            advance.</p>

            for the opportunity. Hopefully the tool will indeed be implemented one day but I have to admit that it would
            require a lot of buy-in and effort to overcome technical contraints. </p>
          <p>If time had permitted it I would've liked to dive deeper into and learn more about justifying the
            viability of the concept to stakeholders, especially from a business standpoint.</p>
          <p> I also would've liked to expand the scope of the tool and explore more user journeys, for example
            envisioning of what comes after a user saves their component list, as that has unfortunately been left open
            ended.</p>

            hotel stays.</p>
          <p>User feedback gathered using Hotjar revealed several pain points on the product details page, particularly
            the inability to buy multiples of a product directly from this page, which was only possible in the shopping

          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>My approach began with an assessment of the existing situation, uncovering the constraints and complexities
            in adding a quantity selector to the sticky bottom bar.</p>

          <p>Next, I explored design patterns employed by other e-commerce platforms before diving into Sketch.</p>

          <h3>Iterations</h3>
          <p>The iterative design process involved collaboration with my team, exploring various solutions through
            sketches and prototypes.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/quantity-selector/2.png" alt="Initial sketch to integrate a quantity selector.">

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>After iterative rounds and stakeholder feedback with the Product Owner, UX Designer, and CRO Specialist, we
            reached a collective decision. We acknowledged the limitations of the sticky bottom bar and opted to
            prioritize the call-to-action and quantity selector within it. Simultaneously, we recognized the potential
            above the fold to accommodate more complex interactions and information, while prominently displaying the
            call-to-action once more.</p>
          <h3>Designs</h3>
          <p>My designs mainly focused on three common scenarios and showcase the situation both above and below the
            fold.</p>

            <img src="./img/quantity-selector/6.png" alt="The end result as seen above the fold">

            <figcaption>Designs of the sticky bottom bar, appearing upon scrolling down, allowing users to select

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The final designs were shared in a Jira ticket, ensuring that they were easily accessible for further
            consideration and implementation by the development team.</p>
          <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
          <p>It's hypothesized that allowing users to purchase multiples of products earlier in the journey reduces
            friction, resulting in increased conversions. This is particularly beneficial for products often sold in
            multiples, such as concert tickets.</p>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <h3>Follow-up Validation</h3>
          <p>As a continuation, and partially validating the solution, an A/B test was conducted to assess featuring the
            add-to-cart call-to-action both above the fold and during scroll. Tracking call-to-action clicks revealed a
            notable increase, supporting the positive impact of this adjustment and suggesting the potential for
            integrating a quantity selector feature.</p>

          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          <p>Some time after my internship ended, my design was able to lay the foundation for the current iteration of
            the product detail page.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/quantity-selector/impl.png"
              alt="The present iteration of the product detail page incorporating much of the design work.">
            <figcaption>The product detail page on mobile above (left) and below the fold (right)</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>This experience taught me the importance of trying different approaches before finding the right solution.
            Collaborating with peers and stakeholders provided valuable feedback. Additionally, working within the
            constraints of mobile-first design emphasized the need to consider alternative solutions and recognize
            limitations.</p>
