      <h2>Talpa eCommerce</h2>
      <h3>Feature: Quantity Selector</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>For my internship at Talpa eCommerce, I worked on a project for their e-commerce website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.actievandedag.nl/">Actie van de Dag</a>, where
        I was tasked with
        designing a solution for selecting the quantity of products a customer wants to purchase. Currently, this
        feature is only available as a dropdown in the shopping cart, but we wanted to also offer it on the product
        detail page. This was particularly important for products like tickets to amusement parks, where customers often
        buy them in multiples to go with family or friends.</p>
      <h4>Research and Analysis</h4>
      <p>To start off, I began by creating screenshots of the current situation to better understand the existing user
        flow. It became clear that designing for mobile would be challenging, as we had a "sticky bottom bar" with the
        call-to-action and price of the product, leaving limited space for a quantity selector.</p>
      <p>I also looked for inspiration from competitors, such as Amazon, who used a dropdown instead of a counter for
        quantity selection, while Coolblue had a counter. I then created rough sketches in Sketch, overlaying the
        screenshots of Actie van de Dag's product detail page on both mobile and desktop, and explored different design
        ideas. Given the limited space in the sticky bottom bar, I came up with the idea of integrating the price into
        the call-to-action, allowing space for the quantity selector, with the price dynamically updating as the
        quantity is adjusted.</p>
      <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
      <p>I presented two design variants to my team, taking into consideration worst-case scenarios where users may need
        to make additional choices such as color or length for products like curtains or concert dates. I also addressed
        concerns about the call-to-action looking crowded when displaying large numbers in the price. I experimented
        with collapsible menus from the sticky bottom bar, but it felt cumbersome.</p>
      <p>After receiving feedback from my team, we agreed that the best approach for mobile would be to have the price
        and call-to-action prominently displayed at the top of the page, allowing ample space for the button, price,
        quantity selector, and multiple choices. The bottom menu bar would then serve as an anchor link to scroll the user towards the quantity selector.</p>
      <h4>Final Design</h4>
      <p>I refined my design based on the feedback and created a Sketch canvas with all the iterations and explorations.
        The final design solution includes a quantity selector integrated into the call-to-action button, with the price
        dynamically updating as the quantity is adjusted. On mobile, the price and call-to-action are prominently
        displayed at the top of the page, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for selecting the quantity
        of products to purchase.</p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Through this project, I was able to design an improved quantity selector feature for Actie van de Dag,
        enhancing the user experience by offering a more convenient and intuitive way for customers to select the
        desired quantity of products. I learned valuable lessons about designing for limited space on mobile devices,
        considering worst-case scenarios, and incorporating feedback from stakeholders to arrive at an optimal design
        solution.</p>
