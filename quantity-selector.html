      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.actievandedag.nl/">Actie van de Dag</a> is a platform owned by Talpa
        eCommerce that specializes in
        selling a variety of discounted products, from furniture and electronics to hotel stays.</p>
      <p>Insights from Hotjar showed that users were missing the ability to buy multiples of a product on the product
        detail page, as right now it was only possible in the shopping cart page.</p>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>During my internship at Talpa eCommerce, I undertook the challenge of incorporating a quantity selector into
          the product detail page. My responsibilities included:</p>
        <li>Audit of the current state</li>
        <li>Competitive analysis</li>
        <li>Iterative mobile-first design</li>
        <li>Stakeholder collaboration</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tools used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hotjar</li>
        <li>Sketch</li>
        <li>Miro</li>
        <li>Jira</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited Screen Real Estate:</strong> Designing the "sticky bottom bar" for mobile, which already
          contains price and call-to-action.</li>
        <li><strong>Products with Variants:</strong> Managing additional screen space required for products with
          multiple options.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment with Brand Guidelines:</strong> Crafting a design that fits seamlessly with the current
          layout and brand identity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>I provided Sketch designs ready for handover, accounting for various scenarios and considerations in the
        implementation of the quantity selector.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/quantity-selector/6.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Final designs, the screen on the left demonstrating the worst-case scenario where users must choose multiple options. Shown
          when scrolled to the top of the page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The final design addressed the challenge by displaying options, price, and add-to-cart button at the top of the
        page, complementing the sticky bottom bar. The latter appears upon scrolling, featuring a quantity selector and
        add-to-cart button. If options need selection, the button smoothly scrolls users to the top of the page.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/quantity-selector/7.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Final sticky bottom bar design, revealed upon scrolling down, allowing users to pick a quantity. If
          users are required to pick options they will be scrolled to the top of the page to do so.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Potential impact</h3>
      <p>By allowing users to purchase multiples of products earlier in the journey, friction was reduced, resulting in
        increased conversions. This is particularly beneficial for products often sold in multiples, such as concert
        tickets.</p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Discovery</h3>
      <p>My approach began with an assessment of the existing situation, uncovering the constraints and complexities in
        adding a
        quantity selector to the sticky bottom bar.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/quantity-selector/8.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Snapshot of the current situation above the fold. Note the sticky bottom bar always being present,
          even when scrolled to the top of the page, leaving us with a limited area to work with if we keep this
          behavior
          intact.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After, I focused on exploring design patterns employed by other e-commerce
        platforms before diving into Sketch.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/quantity-selector/9.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>During my research I often encountered this dropdown pattern as well, which I tried — but decided
          against in favor of the more mobile friendly incremental counter.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Iterations</h3>
      <p>The iterative design process involved collaboration with my team, exploring various solutions through sketches
        and prototypes.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./img/quantity-selector/2.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Initial attempt: Merging the price into the call-to-action to accommodate a quantity selector, but
          at the unwarranted expense of the cart icon and consistency, blunting the affordance—it was clear I had to
          look further</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Variant with options hidden under an "options" toggle, expanding the sticky bottom bar to reveal
          available choices.</figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Handover</h3>
      <p>The final designs were shared in a Jira ticket, ensuring that they were easily accessible for further
        consideration and implementation by the development team.
