          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.actievandedag.nl/">Actie van de Dag</a> is a platform owned by Talpa
            eCommerce that specializes in
            selling a variety of discounted products, from furniture and electronics to hotel stays.</p>
          <p>User feedback gathered using Hotjar made it plain users were missing the ability to buy multiples of a
            product
            on the product
            detail page, as right now it was only possible in the shopping cart page.</p>

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>My approach began with an assessment of the existing situation, uncovering the constraints and complexities
            in
            adding a
            quantity selector to the sticky bottom bar.</p>

            <figcaption>Current situation. Note the sticky bottom bar, containing price and call-to-action, always being
              present
              even when scrolled above the fold. Limiting the addition of complex user interactions such as a quantity
              selector.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>After, I focused on exploring design patterns employed by other e-commerce
            platforms before diving into Sketch.</p>

            <figcaption>During my research I often encountered this dropdown pattern as well, which I tried â€” but
              decided
              against in favor of the more mobile friendly incremental counter.</figcaption>

          <h3>Iterations</h3>
          <p>The iterative design process involved collaboration with my team, exploring various solutions through
            sketches
            and prototypes.</p>

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>After iterative rounds and stakeholder feedback with the product owner, UX designer, and CRO specialist, we
            reached a collective decision. We acknowledged the limitations of the sticky bottom bar and opted to
            prioritize
            the call-to-action and quantity selector within it. Simultaneously, we recognized the potential above the
            fold
            to accommodate more complex interactions and information, while prominently displaying the call-to-action
            once
            more.</p>
          <h3>Designs</h3>
          <p>My designs mainly focused on three common scenarios, and showcase the situation both above and below
            the fold.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/quantity-selector/6.png" alt="The end result as seen above the fold">
            <figcaption>Designs illustrating above-the-fold scenarios where users are prompted to make selections or
              choose
              quantities, or when neither action is necessary.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <img src="./img/quantity-selector/7.png" alt="The end result as seen below the fold">
            <figcaption>Designs of the sticky bottom bar, appearing upon scrolling down, allowing users to select
              quantities if available. If options are required, users are smoothly scrolled to the top of the page.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The final designs were shared in a Jira ticket, ensuring that they were easily accessible for further
            consideration and implementation by the development team.</p>
          <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
          <p>It's hypothesized that allowing users to purchase multiples of products earlier in the journey reduces
            friction, resulting in
            increased conversions. This is particularly beneficial for products often sold in multiples, such as concert
            tickets.</p>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <h3>Follow-up Validation</h3>
          <p>As a continuation, and partially validating the solution, an A/B test was conducted to assess featuring the
            add-to-cart
            call-to-action both above the
            fold and during scroll. Tracking call-to-action clicks revealed a notable increase, supporting the positive
            impact of this adjustment and suggesting the potential for integrating a quantity selector feature.</p>

          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          <p>Some time after my internship ended, my design was able to lay the foundation for the current iteration of the product detail page.</p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>This experience taught me the importance of trying different approaches before finding the right solution.
            Collaborating with peers and stakeholders provided valuable feedback. Additionally, working within the
            constraints of mobile-first design emphasized the need to consider alternative solutions and recognize
            limitations.
